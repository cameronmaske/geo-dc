Real Bed,1,"Hello! This is a new sweet DC themed studio apartment in the heart of the city in the wonderfully fun Dupont Circle neighborhood. This is a great apartment on a quiet street and you can walk to the White House and lots of fun restaurants from the apartment. THE APARTMENT: A quiet studio in an apartment building in Dupont Circle. The building has an elevator. The main room is 350 sq. feet but there is an additional closet, kitchen area, and bathroom. NEIGHBORHOOD: If you don't know much about DC, let me tell you that Dupont Circle is the best neighborhood in town. The rent here has reached the same levels as in Manhattan in NYC and when an apartment is open in the area, it gets snatched up in a second. Tree lined streets, amazing restaurants, hip bars and a big grocery store are within one block of the apartment and I hope you can experience it by staying here! The neighborhood is extremely safe, the shops are cute, the people are nice, the bars are fun and you can walk to the White House and all of downtown. It's pretty much everything you could ask for in this town. This may not be the biggest apartment on Airbnb in DC but it just may be the one in the best location. NOTE: This is a BRAND NEW apartment unit that I just got. I'll be adding more furniture and some art on the walls probably in time for your reservation but I wanted to get some photos up so you get an idea of what it looks like! A QUEEN SIZE BED is in the room and you will be provided with fresh sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner and soap.The bathroom has a full tub. And of course you could just use it for a shower. A hairdryer is provided.There is free WIFI. In addition there is obviously an air conditioner unit/fan and lots of heat. There is no TV. There is a large refrigerator. Feel free to stock up and store any food or anything you need in the kitchen. The stove/oven in the apartment are ready for you to use. There is a microwave! There is a toaster! There is a coffee machine! There are six wine glasses and six regular glasses! There are also six regular size plates and six little plates all for you. And three fun mugs. And martini glasses! And shot glasses! Yay!There are washing machines and dryers in the basement of my building. You can feel free to go down there and wash all your clothes. You have to buy a card for five dollars before you can wash anything. It is two dollars for a wash and two dollars to dry.I have a book of helpful information for your stay. It includes maps, information on local restaurants, helpful tips on the apartment, etc. I also have the most recent Lonely Planet DC city guide for you so don't buy a guidebook if you stay here!THE LOCATION: Dupont Circle Area. The apartment is a five to ten minute walk from the Dupont Circle Metro Stop on the Red Line. You could also walk from the Green/Yellow Line's U-Street/African-American Civil War Memorial Stop but it would take about 20-25 minutes. The apartment building is located one building off of trendy 17th Street which is filled with restaurants, bars, nail salons, yogurt places, etc. A large grocery store is around the corner. Also there are two liquor stores and a 7-11 within feet of the apartment. From the apartment you could walk to the White House (about 20 minutes) or to the U-Street area (about 8 minutes) or Dupont Circle (about 5 minutes) or over to 14th Street (about 10 minutes). I repeat, within one block there is a 7-11 Convenience store, a supermarket, two liquor stores, a dry cleaner, numerous food options, a bar, etc. All sorts of fun!ACCESS: You can take the Metro's Red Line to Dupont Circle. From there it is a 5-10 minute walk. There are also numerous bus options available. Washington DC is a very walkable city and you can walk to the White House and other attractions easily from here. Perhaps more importantly, the area is overflowing with great restaurants!ROOMMATES: You will have the apartment to yourself. There are no roommates. I will just make sure to you have two sets of keys to the apartment. I have no dogs, cats, or pets of any kind. Please do not bring animals into the building. There is no smoking in the building.ROOM: The room will sleep two comfortably in the amazing queen bed. You could also put an additional third person on the futon. Woohoo! I will provide clean sheets and towels.EXTRAS: Hair Dryer, Wifi, Coffee Pot, Toaster, Microwave, Shampoo, Conditioner, Soap, Clean Towels, Iron, Ironing Board, Playing Cards, Lonely Planet Washington DC - all sorts of fun.BED: QUEEN (!!!) bed. Yay! FUTON: The futon is the blue couch pictured. You just press it back and it turns into a bed. Full Disclosure - This futon is from Target (like Ikea) and it is a reliable futon but not the world's most comfortable. I wouldn't tell my mother to sleep here but I think most of my 20 something friends would not mind sleeping on the futon. IRON: There is an iron and an ironing board in the apartment. Please feel free to use it. PARKING: DC is not a car friendly city. The apartment is a 5-10 minute walk to the Dupont Circle Metro stop. The apartment is also on many major bus routes. If you really want to bring your car, you can park it on the street for free on weekends and holidays but PLEASE pay attention to the street signs. Parking tickets in DC usually run around $100. If I had a car here, I would not risk worrying about street parking and I would park in one of the nearby garages. There is a parking garage at 17th and P Street where you can park your car for $16 a day. The garage is a five minute walk from my apartment. Many guests have kept their car there while staying at my place. CHECK IN/CHECK OUT: I have a flexible checkin/checkout time listed. It makes sense to me to be as flexible as possible to allow guests the best stay! That said, please let me know 7 days - one week - before your arrival when you plan to arrive and when you plan to check out. If you do not let me know your arrival and departure plans, your check in time will be 2pm and your check out time will be noon. Also - PLEASE - do not assume you can check in before noon. If you want to check in earlier than 2pm, please check with me in advance. Everything will probably work out, just let me know. I look forward to your stay :-)Remember! This is a brand new apartment and more fun (furniture, art) will be added soon.",38.90991875842942,75,1,Entire home/flat,-77.0398520905465

Real Bed,1,"An English basement like no other...this one has a to-die-for kitchen and a cavernous walk-in closet that others would consider a separate bedroom. The apartment's one bedroom has a queen-sized bed plus a home office nook with a large antique oak desk and chair. The living room has a full-sized Jennifer convertible sofa bed that sleeps two extra people, and for parties of more than 4 people (or for parties of 3 or 4 at the party's request for more beds, for an additional fee), one or two twin (single) or queen-sized airbeds are provided.Includes bed linens, bath towels, and a fully-equipped kitchen, down to the coffee pot, crock pot and George Foreman grill (plus gas and charcoal grills and an electric smoker are available for your use outside.)

Cleaning supplies and hand soap are provided, but please bring whatever toiletries you want to use in the shower or bathtub.Our laundry room with Whirlpool Duet washer and dryer is shared with those of us living in our home above the apartment, and we must access it through the short center hallway of the apartment. So that the apartment occupants are not disturbed too early in the morning or late in the evening, we limit laundry room hours for the occupants of the main house (normally 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., but we can shift those hours if need be.)Premium location: 10 minute walk to restaurants, grocery stores, drug stores, etc. in Glover Park and Cleveland Park; 1 mile walk to Georgetown University and American University; 10-minute bus to Dupont Circle; 20-minute bus to Foggy Bottom; walk, drive, or take a bus past the Vice President's residence and along Embassy Row on Massachusetts Avenue. The apartment is just three blocks to Washington National Cathedral, and three miles to the White House and National Mall. .Notice for those with severe allergies to pets: On rare occasions, we have guests who bring their pets along on their travels. While we do work hard to clean the apartment in between guests, those who are extremely allergic to cats or dogs may want to contact us before booking to discuss whether a pet has been in the apartment recently. We do have two cats in our home above the apartment, and the air conditioning ductwork is connected between the apartment and the main floor of our home.Options available for an additional fee:1. Parking. Parking on the street is relatively easy, but for those without resident parking permits (which we buy when we register our cars in DC every year), weekday parking is limited to two hours. We can obtain a permit for your car for $15/day. Without the permit, you are at a very high risk of receiving a parking ticket after two hours on weekdays; Washington's parking enforcement officers are very efficient!2. Grocery shopping. Let us know what you would like to buy, and we will have it waiting for you upon your arrival for the cost of the groceries plus a shopping/delivery fee of $25.3. Pet care/dog walking. $20 for a 30-minute session, $30 for a 60-minute session.",38.927334,137,1,Entire home/flat,-77.075684
Real Bed,1,"Hello,I believe in people helping each other to avoid expensive hotels and enjoy a casual vacation, and I often use AirBnB myself when I travel. That's why it's important for me to make your stay in my place comfortable and pleasant and not much different from being home. You can count on respectful and considerate attitude and I will expect the same in return. I have a few simple house rules to be observed (please check those separately) and in return, I am very flexible with the arrangements and accommodation. For my guests to offer, I also have two metro Smart Trip cards (rechargeable chip-cards that also give you a slight discount on the metro fare), a visitors parking pass for free daily street parking in front of my building (in case you drive), and the possibility of bike rentals through me (to be discussed on a case by case basis). Also, when you rent just a room, don’t be concerned about sharing with strangers. I don’t operate as a hostel – this is my home, I live her, and I only rent my guest bedroom (one at a time), while I live in the other. So you do get to share with me as the host, but that’s it – no in and out traffic, no strangers. Washington D.C. has two faces – Washington the Nation’s Capitol, and D.C. as the city itself. The Nation’s Capitol has the well known historic and government landmarks and museums (Capitol Building, Library of Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Smithsonian Museums, the National Cathedral, the national monuments, etc.). When you book with me, I would help you get beyond the Nation’s Capitol and discover the other face of D.C. – the city and its vibrant neighborhoods, cultural and nightlife, thriving restaurant scene, farmers markets, and a good number of creative places that offer an eclectic selection of crafty coffee making, microbrews (and microbrew imports), and rare spirits from small badge bourbon and scotch distilleries. Also to clarify, guests are often confused by the name “AirBnB” and inquire with me about breakfast provided, rides to/from the airport, and sightseeing tours around the city. AirBnB is al bed and breakfast only in name and only virtually. The only thing I offer is affordable accommodation, good hosting and some good suggestions to make your experience in DC real good. Well, I also do offer to my guests all the tea and coffee in the house, and often when I am prepared, I will treat them to wine and beer. The rest is up to you and I could only help with ideas.THE APARTMENTMy place to share is a modern two bedroom condo on the second floor in a small 4 unit building. I have a separate listing for the whole apartment, but I also rent the rooms separately to low-key travelers on a budget. The guest bedroom listed here is the smaller of the two and has a queen size futon. The apartment has one bathroom (that we share), a fully equipped modern kitchen, and a large wooden deck with patio furniture and a propane grill. The apartment is clean, tidy, well-maintained, and non-smoking home. A couple of other features include:- Wireless Internet- TV and cable- PS3 with a Netflix account and a DVD/Blu-Ray player (and FIFA 2013 if you care hahaha)- A laptop-to-TV video and sound connectors- A stereo with 2 ceiling and 2 stand-alone speakers- Washer and dryer in unit- Dishwasher- Central air- Jet tub- A decent size fenced in grassy yard on the side of the building (bike can be locked on the iron fence)- A guest street parking pass and plenty of street parking available, including two unzoned streets a block awayNEIGHBORHOOD AND LOCATION The neighborhood is small, residential, quiet and safe. Eckington is conveniently located in the heart of the city geographically. It's only 1.4 miles to Union Station, Capitol Hill, the National Mall, and all the Smithsonian museums, which is all easily within walking distance (or 1 metro stop – Union Station). The condo is also a 10 minute walk to DC's most useful red metro line (the stop is NoMa) and the walk is on a pedestrian/bike trail with no car traffic and a straight shot to the metro stop. In terms of transportation, besides being on the metro, the neighborhood is also a major city cycling area with the Metropolitan Branch Trail (connecting Union Station with Silver Spring and MD) running straight through it, together with several streets with bike lanes that connect directly to downtown, Dupont Circle and Georgetown. The city bike (Capital Bikeshare) sharing program also has several renting stations in the neighborhood, where you can check out bikes by the minute or by the hour.Although quiet and residential, Eckington is surrounded by two of the newest and most hip DC neighborhoods - NoMA and Bloomingdale. Both are within a 10 minute walk and offer a constantly growing number of coffee shops, restaurant and dining options, fast bites, bars, grocery stores, and various activities: BREAKFAST, BRUNCH, LUNCH, AND DINING• Big Bear café – probably the coolest joint around here, wind very crafty coffee, patio garden, and ever changing eclectic dinner menu on candle light (10-15 mins walk). • Windows café – easy neighborhood, deli type café (10-15 mins walk).• Grassroots Gourmet – a family bakery that uses fine ingredients to bake from scratch.• Rustic Tavern – great brick oven pizza and creative ingredients (10-15 mins walk).• Aroi Fine Thai and Japanese cuisine – traditional Thai and sushi (10-15 mins walk).• Bacio Pizzeria – great take out joint with excellent gourmet pizza (10-15 mins walk).• Beau Thai – modern Thai joint (15-20 mins walk).• Todd Gray's Watershed – an upscale, celebrity-chef restaurant (10-15 mins walk)• Fast bite options around the NoMA metro stop (15 mins walk):- 5 Guys burgers- Roti Mediterranean Grill- Au Bon Pain- Potbelly- Starbucks• *A Litteri – an authentic Italian grocer and deli with a mindblowing selection of wine, meats, olive oil, cheese, and anything Italian. They make great sandwiches too. This one is a true gem (15-20 min walk).• *Union Market – an old historic marketplace that has been recently renovated and is now one of the hippest gems in town and a serious rival to Eastern Market. It has and artisan feel and offers an original mix of meats, cheese, produce, seafood, bakery, smokery, creamery, Korean BBQ tacos, empanadas, olive oil, gelato, coffee, cupcakes, fine wine and beers, flowers (15-20 mins walk).• *Thai X-ing – probably the best and most famous Thai restaurant in the city, which is actually in the chef’s house and serves traditional home-style Thai recipes passed down from his family in an intimate home setting. Keep in mind that although it is not pretentious, reservations are a good idea, just because of the high traffic (25-30 mins walk). BARSBoundary Stone Public House – a very aesthetic neighborhood bar (but also popular all across the city) that offers crafted beers, an amazing bourbon list, and good food (10-15 mins walk).PHARMACY AND GROCERIES • McKinley Market – a small grocer/convenience store just around the corner (less than 5 min walk).• New Star Supermarket – a decent size neighborhood supermarket where you can find pretty much everything you need for cheap. It just hasn’t caught up with the organic/fancy food revolution yet – I am still a fan (10 mins walk).• Harris Teeter – the nicest grocery store around in terms of food quality and organic choices. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the NoMa metro).• Giant – a typical big American chain supermarket that offers everything and anything, generally cheaper than Harris Teeter. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the Rhode Island Ave metro).• Sunday farmers market by Big Bear Café.• CVS – two pharmacies, one by the NoMA metro and one by the Rhode Island Ave Metro (both 10-15 mins walk).SPORTS AND ACTIVITIESThere are multiple public sport facilities in the area, including indoor and outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, track, basketball courts, football and soccer fields, bike trails and city bike lanes, and the city’s only bike polo ground where pick-up games take place on Monday and Thursday night.• Harry Thomas Recreation Center – outdoor pool in the summer, gym, baseball field, tennis courts, basketball courts (10 mins walk).• McKinley Tech High School – football/soccer field and track (5 mins walk).• Trinity College - indoor Olympic pool (25 min walk)• Project Fitness Chickaro – gym and personal training (10 mins walk).• Brentwood Park – bike polo (20 min walk)ENTERTAINMENTIn terms of entertainment, the H Street Corridor/Atlas District and the U street area are both well known for their night life. Both are also 1.5 miles away, or a 30-40 minute walk. To all my reservations, I will email specific suggestions on DC gems and must-go places for live music, shows, night life, dining, pizza, crafty beer, coffee etc. that go beyond the neighborhood and explore the best of the city.",38.91491517377868,33,1,Private room,-77.00254197667674

LOCATION & TRANSPORTATIONThe apartment is located 2 blocks from the Columbia Heights Metro Station on the Green & Yellow Lines. It is also convenient to the Circulator, 40's, 50's and S bus lines. There are 4 grocery stores within a short walk, and restaurants, coffee shops, and spirits are even closer. The apartment is also a short walk to the lively Adams Morgan Neighborhood and steps from Rock Creek Park and the National Zoo.There is no parking included. The only parking available is metered or time-limited. If you are planning on staying for a longer term, a free guest parking pass can be arranged upon your arrival.SLEEPY TIMEThe bedroom has a desk, a queen bed, 32-inch LCD HDTV w/Cable, and a dresser/armoire for your use. The queen sheets are 800 thread count cotton sateen. There is a medium-fill goose down duvet with a Belgian linen duvet cover. The incredibly comfortable yet supportive mattress also has a mattress pad for additional comfort.There is a second bed for additional guests in the form of a comfortable full/double-sized sleeper sofa. To heighten comfort there is also a mattress pad for the sofa bed. The unit has 17-foot (5 meter) ceilings, with unique details including a full white-painted exposed brick wall in the living room. The decor is ""beach chic"" featuring an eclectic mix of antiques, Ikea, Crate & Barrell, Room & Board, and Restoration Hardware pieces. Outside of the unit there is a small patio area with Weber charcoal grill for your use.All pillows are fluffy Pacific Coast goose down pillows that are regularly cleaned. BATH TIMEThe bathroom is small but highly functional. There is one sink, one toilet, and one shower tub. White amenities and tiles contrast with the native bluestone floor tiles. The bath linens are plush Turkish cotton bath towels. There are additional towels located in the bedroom armoire, along with more linens and wash cloths.FEEDING TIMEThe kitchen is tiny by almost anyone's standards, but it's highly functional. There is a 2-burner electric induction stovetop, black quartz countertops, a chalkboard, sink with garbage disposal, dishwasher, combination microwave/convection/oven and a refrigerator/freezer. There are plates and silverware and serving ware to fit any meal. LOUNGE TIMEThe living room also plays double duty as the dining room—there is a small fold-out table that is hidden inside the living room closet which can comfortably seat 4 people. In addition to the sleeper sofa, there are three other upholstered chairs in the living room. The gray storage ottomans hide additional guest linens and also double as tables when the top is flipped. There is a 52-inch 1080p LCD HDTV with a generous Comcast cable package that includes expanded channels, HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax. There is also a BluRay player (which has Netflix) and a Nintendo Wii with four controllers. There aren't many new games other than Wii Sports and Mario, but it's loaded up with a bunch of old-school original NES titles. What else could you want?There is an antique ladder that is used to hold plush blankets for cuddling up on the couch. OUTDOOR TIMEYou'll notice out front when you walk up that there is a nice little brick patio with banquette seating. There is also a Weber charcoal grill which you can use. Just be mindful of the friendly neighbors in the building, as it is a shared space. The grilling tools are kept inside the main apartment door, to the right when you walk in.MORE ABOUT THE BUILDINGThe building is a walk-up and is not handicapped-accesible. There is a flight of stairs to get from the ground to the front door, and then there is another two flights to reach the apartment. Stairs are annoying, but it's worth it.The building was gutted to the facade and rebuilt from scratch in 2006 so everything inside the building is pretty new. There is a small coin-operated washer and dryer on the first floor upon entering the building. It accepts only quarters (25c) and costs $2.00 per wash and $2.00 per dry. Additionally there are several laundromats and dry cleaners within one block of apartment building.ONE MORE THING...This apartment has been a life-changing home for me and I hope that in whatever time you get to spend here, it feels the same. I'm an insanely neat and tidy person so you'll be getting a place in great condition and would ask that you return it the same. Because this is still my primary residence, you'll see some personal effects around. Don't break them if you can. :D",38.92873,95,1,Entire home/flat,-77.037369

That's why it's important for me to make your stay in my place comfortable and pleasant and not much different from being home. You can count on respectful and considerate attitude and I will expect the same in return. I have a few simple house rules to be observed (please check those separately) and in return, I am very flexible with the arrangements and accommodation. For my guests to offer, I also have two metro Smart Trip cards (rechargeable chip-cards that also give you a slight discount on the metro fare), a visitors parking pass for free daily street parking in front of my building (in case you drive), and the possibility of bike rentals through me (to be discussed on a case by case basis).Washington D.C. has two faces – Washington the Nation’s Capitol, and D.C. as the city itself. The Nation’s Capitol has the well known historic and government landmarks and museums (Capitol Building, Library of Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Smithsonian Museums, the National Cathedral, the national monuments, etc.). When you book with me, I would help you get beyond the Nation’s Capitol and discover the other face of D.C. – the city and its vibrant neighborhoods, cultural and nightlife, thriving restaurant scene, farmers markets, and a good number of creative places that offer an eclectic selection of crafty coffee making, microbrews (and microbrew imports), and rare spirits from small badge bourbon and scotch distilleries. Also to clarify, guests are often confused by the name “AirBnB” and inquire with me about breakfast provided, rides to/from the airport, and sightseeing tours around the city. AirBnB is al bed and breakfast only in name and only virtually. The only thing I offer is affordable accommodation, good hosting and some good suggestions to make your experience in DC real good. Well, I also do offer to my guests all the tea and coffee in the house, and often when I am prepared, I will treat them to wine and beer. The rest is up to you and I could only help with ideas.THE APARTMENTMy place to share is a modern two bedroom condo on the second floor in a small 4 unit building. I have a queen size bed with a tempurpedic mattress in the master bedroom and a comfortable queen size futon in the guest bedroom. If need be, I also have a roll out bed and the couch in the living room can sleep one person. However, the apartment only has one bathroom which can make it tight for groups bigger than 3-4 people. The kitchen is modern and fully equipped and there is also a large wooden deck with patio furniture and a propane grill. The apartment is clean, tidy, well-maintained, and non-smoking home. A couple of other features include:- Wireless Internet- TV and cable- PS3 with a Netflix account and a DVD/Blu-Ray player (and FIFA 2013 if you care hahaha)- A laptop-to-TV video and sound connectors- A stereo with 2 ceiling and 2 stand-alone speakers- Washer and dryer in unit- Dishwasher- Central air- Jet tub- A decent size fenced in grassy yard on the side of the building (bike can be locked on the iron fence)NEIGHBORHOOD AND LOCATION The neighborhood is small, residential, quiet and safe. Eckington is conveniently located in the heart of the city geographically. It's only 1.4 miles to Union Station, Capitol Hill, the National Mall, and all the Smithsonian museums, which is all easily within walking distance (or 1 metro stop – Union Station). The condo is also a 10 minute walk to DC's most useful red metro line (the stop is NoMa) and the walk is on a pedestrian/bike trail with no car traffic and a straight shot to the metro stop. In terms of transportation, besides being on the metro, the neighborhood is also a major city cycling area with the Metropolitan Branch Trail (connecting Union Station with Silver Spring and MD) running straight through it, together with several streets with bike lanes that connect directly to downtown, Dupont Circle and Georgetown. The city bike (Capital Bikeshare) sharing program also has several renting stations in the neighborhood, where you can check out bikes by the minute or by the hour.Although quiet and residential, Eckington is surrounded by two of the newest and most hip DC neighborhoods - NoMA and Bloomingdale. Both are within a 10 minute walk and offer a constantly growing number of coffee shops, restaurant and dining options, fast bites, bars, grocery stores, and various activities: BREAKFAST, BRUNCH, LUNCH, AND DINING• Big Bear café – probably the coolest joint around here, wind very crafty coffee, patio garden, and ever changing eclectic dinner menu on candle light (10-15 mins walk). • Windows café – easy neighborhood, deli type café (10-15 mins walk).• Grassroots Gourmet – a family bakery that uses fine ingredients to bake from scratch.• Rustic Tavern – great brick oven pizza and creative ingredients (10-15 mins walk).• Aroi Fine Thai and Japanese cuisine – traditional Thai and sushi (10-15 mins walk).• Bacio Pizzeria – great take out joint with excellent gourmet pizza (10-15 mins walk).• Beau Thai – modern Thai joint (15-20 mins walk).• Todd Gray's Watershed – an upscale, celebrity-chef restaurant (10-15 mins walk)• Fast bite options around the NoMA metro stop (15 mins walk):- 5 Guys burgers- Roti Mediterranean Grill- Au Bon Pain- Potbelly- Starbucks• *A Litteri – an authentic Italian grocer and deli with a mindblowing selection of wine, meats, olive oil, cheese, and anything Italian. They make great sandwiches too. This one is a true gem (15-20 min walk).• *Union Market – an old historic marketplace that has been recently renovated and is now one of the hippest gems in town and a serious rival to Eastern Market. It has and artisan feel and offers an original mix of meats, cheese, produce, seafood, bakery, smokery, creamery, Korean BBQ tacos, empanadas, olive oil, gelato, coffee, cupcakes, fine wine and beers, flowers (15-20 mins walk).• *Thai X-ing – probably the best and most famous Thai restaurant in the city, which is actually in the chef’s house and serves traditional home-style Thai recipes passed down from his family in an intimate home setting. Keep in mind that although it is not pretentious, reservations are a good idea, just because of the high traffic (25-30 mins walk). BARSBoundary Stone Public House – a very aesthetic neighborhood bar (but also popular all across the city) that offers crafted beers, an amazing bourbon list, and good food (10-15 mins walk).PHARMACY AND GROCERIES • McKinley Market – a small grocer/convenience store just around the corner (less than 5 min walk).• New Star Supermarket – a decent size neighborhood supermarket where you can find pretty much everything you need for cheap. It just hasn’t caught up with the organic/fancy food revolution yet – I am still a fan (10 mins walk).• Harris Teeter – the nicest grocery store around in terms of food quality and organic choices. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the NoMa metro).• Giant – a typical big American chain supermarket that offers everything and anything, generally cheaper than Harris Teeter. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the Rhode Island Ave metro).• Sunday farmers market by Big Bear Café.• CVS – two pharmacies, one by the NoMA metro and one by the Rhode Island Ave Metro (both 10-15 mins walk).SPORTS AND ACTIVITIESThere are multiple public sport facilities in the area, including indoor and outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, track, basketball courts, football and soccer fields, bike trails and city bike lanes, and the city’s only bike polo ground where pick-up games take place on Monday and Thursday night.• Harry Thomas Recreation Center – outdoor pool in the summer, gym, baseball field, tennis courts, basketball courts (10 mins walk).• McKinley Tech High School – football/soccer field and track (5 mins walk).• Trinity College - indoor Olympic pool (25 min walk)• Project Fitness Chickaro – gym and personal training (10 mins walk).• Brentwood Park – bike polo (20 min walk)ENTERTAINMENTIn terms of entertainment, the H Street Corridor/Atlas District and the U street area are both well known for their night life. Both are also 1.5 miles away, or a 30-40 minute walk. To all my reservations, I will email specific suggestions on DC gems and must-go places for live music, shows, night life, dining, pizza, crafty beer, coffee etc. that go beyond the neighborhood and explore the best of the city.",38.91521129049214,78,2,Entire home/flat,-77.00129779393626

Real Bed,,"I am renting a fully furnished housed in west georgetown, two blocks from the university. The house has three double bedrooms, 4 bathrooms (3 with shower), a very large living room with a 70 inch tv, a full kitchen, and a yard with a grill. It has a total of 6 beds with a pull out couch in the living room. The house is in the nicest part of Georgetown blocks from M street which is the best shopping in georgetown and the center of the nightlifeThe house is available from May 12 to May 28th. More info:The closest metro stop is Rosslyn, which is about a 15 minute walk over the key bridge. However there are endless (and preferable) ways to get to to the mall area. The two closes monuments are the Lincoln Memorial and the Jefferson Memorial/ tidal basin, which are 2-3 miles (I run there from the house all the time!). Beyond that I'd say the rest of the monuments/mall are less than 4 or 5 miles, so it is definitely walkable, especially when the weather is so beautiful. Also, there are several buses that will take you to that area that all go through Georgetown. The circulator ($1 fare) and the regular metro buses, though I don't know the exact routes. There is also a bike share a couple blocks from our house. A cab would run you about $12, which is probably only a little more than taking your whole family on the metro (maybe $2 each way per person). I didn't spend very much time on the listing but this house is a great deal. We pay $8000 (6 people) a month so its a pretty nice house for Georgetown. We are all going home after exams but have our lease until June 1 so thought we would try to get a little money back. Since we live there all year round it has everything you would need- yard, kitchen, laundry machines, enormous tv, bathrooms, etc. There is sort of a driveway/parking spot (I say sort of because we have a deal with the landlord on it) but if you need it we might be able to figure something out. Let me know if there any other questions I can answer. Like I said, we super under-priced the house, so it's a great deal for the location/ what it is.

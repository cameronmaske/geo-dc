A map of neighorhood boundaries in the District of Columbia.
The Washington Post derived the neighborhood boundaries by reviewing original subdivision data,
by reviewing neighborhood maps published in The Post's Where We Live real estate section and by
consulting community sources. The 217 neighborhoods shown are intended for standardized data
analysis purposes. Work based on data acquired from Washington Post's Homicides in the
District interactive map. See http://apps.washingtonpost.com/investigative/homicides/
Data was scraped/cleaned up by Justin Grimes @justgrimes from Code for DC

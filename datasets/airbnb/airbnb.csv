,"Hello! This is a new sweet DC themed studio apartment in the heart of the city in the wonderfully fun Dupont Circle neighborhood. This is a great apartment on a quiet street and you can walk to the White House and lots of fun restaurants from the apartment. THE APARTMENT: A quiet studio in an apartment building in Dupont Circle. The building has an elevator. The main room is 350 sq. feet but there is an additional closet, kitchen area, and bathroom. NEIGHBORHOOD: If you don't know much about DC, let me tell you that Dupont Circle is the best neighborhood in town. The rent here has reached the same levels as in Manhattan in NYC and when an apartment is open in the area, it gets snatched up in a second. Tree lined streets, amazing restaurants, hip bars and a big grocery store are within one block of the apartment and I hope you can experience it by staying here! The neighborhood is extremely safe, the shops are cute, the people are nice, the bars are fun and you can walk to the White House and all of downtown. It's pretty much everything you could ask for in this town. This may not be the biggest apartment on Airbnb in DC but it just may be the one in the best location. A QUEEN SIZE BED is in the room and you will be provided with fresh sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner and soap.The bathroom has a full tub. And of course you could just use it for a shower. A hairdryer is provided.There is free WIFI. In addition there is obviously an air conditioner unit/fan and lots of heat. There is no TV. There is a large refrigerator. Feel free to stock up and store any food or anything you need in the kitchen. The stove/oven in the apartment are ready for you to use. There is a microwave! There is a toaster! There is a coffee machine! There are six wine glasses and six regular glasses! There are also six regular size plates and six little plates all for you. And three fun mugs. And martini glasses! And shot glasses! Yay!There are washing machines and dryers in the basement of my building. You can feel free to go down there and wash all your clothes. You have to buy a card for five dollars before you can wash anything. It is two dollars for a wash and two dollars to dry.I have a book of helpful information for your stay. It includes maps, information on local restaurants, helpful tips on the apartment, etc. I also have the most recent Lonely Planet DC city guide for you so don't buy a guidebook if you stay here!THE LOCATION: Dupont Circle Area. The apartment is a five to ten minute walk from the Dupont Circle Metro Stop on the Red Line. You could also walk from the Green/Yellow Line's U-Street/African-American Civil War Memorial Stop but it would take about 20-25 minutes. The apartment building is located one building off of trendy 17th Street which is filled with restaurants, bars, nail salons, yogurt places, etc. A large grocery store is around the corner. Also there are two liquor stores and a 7-11 within feet of the apartment. From the apartment you could walk to the White House (about 20 minutes) or to the U-Street area (about 8 minutes) or Dupont Circle (about 5 minutes) or over to 14th Street (about 10 minutes). I repeat, within one block there is a 7-11 Convenience store, a supermarket, two liquor stores, a dry cleaner, numerous food options, a bar, etc. All sorts of fun!ACCESS: You can take the Metro's Red Line to Dupont Circle. From there it is a 5-10 minute walk. There are also numerous bus options available. Washington DC is a very walkable city and you can walk to the White House and other attractions easily from here. Perhaps more importantly, the area is overflowing with great restaurants!ROOMMATES: You will have the apartment to yourself. There are no roommates. I will just make sure to you have two sets of keys to the apartment. I have no dogs, cats, or pets of any kind. Please do not bring animals into the building. There is no smoking in the building.ROOM: The room will sleep two comfortably in the amazing queen bed. You could also put an additional third person on the futon. Woohoo! I will provide clean sheets and towels.EXTRAS: Hair Dryer, Wifi, Coffee Pot, Toaster, Microwave, Shampoo, Conditioner, Soap, Clean Towels, Iron, Ironing Board, Playing Cards, Lonely Planet Washington DC - all sorts of fun.BED: QUEEN (!!!) bed. Yay! FUTON: The futon is the blue couch pictured. You just press it back and it turns into a bed. Full Disclosure - This futon is from Target (like Ikea) and it is a reliable futon but not the world's most comfortable. I wouldn't tell my mother to sleep here but I think most of my 20 something friends would not mind sleeping on the futon. IRON: There is an iron and an ironing board in the apartment. Please feel free to use it. PARKING: DC is not a car friendly city. The apartment is a 5-10 minute walk to the Dupont Circle Metro stop. The apartment is also on many major bus routes. If you really want to bring your car, you can park it on the street for free on weekends and holidays but PLEASE pay attention to the street signs. Parking tickets in DC usually run around $100. If I had a car here, I would not risk worrying about street parking and I would park in one of the nearby garages. There is a parking garage at 17th and P Street where you can park your car for $16 a day. The garage is a five minute walk from my apartment. Many guests have kept their car there while staying at my place. CHECK IN/CHECK OUT: I have a flexible checkin/checkout time listed. It makes sense to me to be as flexible as possible to allow guests the best stay! That said, please try to check in after 2pm (or later) and please try to leave before noon (or earlier). If you need to check in earlier or check out later, let me know. It will probably work out!

,"An English basement like no other...this one has a to-die-for kitchen and a cavernous walk-in closet that others would consider a separate bedroom. The apartment's one bedroom has a queen-sized bed plus a home office nook with a large antique oak desk and chair. The living room has a full-sized Jennifer convertible sofa bed that sleeps two extra people, and for parties of more than 4 people (or for parties of 3 or 4 at the party's request for more beds, for an additional fee), one or two twin (single) or queen-sized airbeds are provided.Includes bed linens, bath towels, and a fully-equipped kitchen, down to the coffee pot, crock pot and George Foreman grill (plus gas and charcoal grills and an electric smoker are available for your use outside.) WIFI is strong and the flatscreen TV provides cable and DVD viewing. Cleaning supplies and hand soap are provided, but please bring whatever toiletries you want to use in the shower or bathtub.Our laundry room with Whirlpool Duet washer and dryer is shared with those of us living in our home above the apartment, and we must access it through the short center hallway of the apartment. So that the apartment occupants are not disturbed too early in the morning or late in the evening, we limit laundry room hours for the occupants of the main house (normally 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., but we can shift those hours if need be.)Premium location: 10 minute walk to restaurants, grocery stores, drug stores, etc. in Glover Park and Cleveland Park; 1 mile walk to Georgetown University and American University; 10-minute bus to Dupont Circle; 20-minute bus to Foggy Bottom; walk, drive, or take a bus past the Vice President's residence and along Embassy Row on Massachusetts Avenue. The apartment is just three blocks to Washington National Cathedral, and three miles to the White House and National Mall. .Notice for those with severe allergies to pets: On rare occasions, we have guests who bring their pets along on their travels. While we do work hard to clean the apartment in between guests, those who are extremely allergic to cats or dogs may want to contact us before booking to discuss whether a pet has been in the apartment recently. We do have two cats in our home above the apartment, and the air conditioning ductwork is connected between the apartment and the main floor of our home.Options available for an additional fee:1. Parking. Parking on the street is relatively easy, but for those without resident parking permits (which we buy when we register our cars in DC every year), weekday parking is limited to two hours.

,"Hello,I believe in people helping each other to avoid expensive hotels and enjoy a casual vacation, and I often use AirBnB myself when I travel. That's why it's important for me to make your stay in my place comfortable and pleasant and not much different from being home. You can count on respectful and considerate attitude and I will expect the same in return. I have a few simple house rules to be observed (please check those separately) and in return, I am very flexible with the arrangements and accommodation. For my guests to offer, I also have two metro Smart Trip cards (rechargeable chip-cards that also give you a slight discount on the metro fare), a visitors parking pass for free daily street parking in front of my building (in case you drive), and the possibility of bike rentals through me (to be discussed on a case by case basis). Also, when you rent just a room, don’t be concerned about sharing with strangers. I don’t operate as a hostel – this is my home, I live her, and I only rent my guest bedroom (one at a time), while I live in the other. So you do get to share with me as the host, but that’s it – no in and out traffic, no strangers. Washington D.C. has two faces – Washington the Nation’s Capitol, and D.C. as the city itself. The Nation’s Capitol has the well known historic and government landmarks and museums (Capitol Building, Library of Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Smithsonian Museums, the National Cathedral, the national monuments, etc.). When you book with me, I would help you get beyond the Nation’s Capitol and discover the other face of D.C. – the city and its vibrant neighborhoods, cultural and nightlife, thriving restaurant scene, farmers markets, and a good number of creative places that offer an eclectic selection of crafty coffee making, microbrews (and microbrew imports), and rare spirits from small badge bourbon and scotch distilleries. Also to clarify, guests are often confused by the name “AirBnB” and inquire with me about breakfast provided, rides to/from the airport, and sightseeing tours around the city. AirBnB is al bed and breakfast only in name and only virtually. The only thing I offer is affordable accommodation, good hosting and some good suggestions to make your experience in DC real good. Well, I also do offer to my guests all the tea and coffee in the house, and often when I am prepared, I will treat them to wine and beer. The rest is up to you and I could only help with ideas.THE APARTMENTMy place to share is a modern two bedroom condo on the second floor in a small 4 unit building. I have a separate listing for the whole apartment, but I also rent the rooms separately to low-key travelers on a budget. The guest bedroom listed here is the smaller of the two and has a queen size futon. The apartment has one bathroom (that we share), a fully equipped modern kitchen, and a large wooden deck with patio furniture and a propane grill. The apartment is clean, tidy, well-maintained, and non-smoking home. A couple of other features include:- Wireless Internet- TV and cable- PS3 with a Netflix account and a DVD/Blu-Ray player (and FIFA 2013 if you care hahaha)- A laptop-to-TV video and sound connectors- A stereo with 2 ceiling and 2 stand-alone speakers- Washer and dryer in unit- Dishwasher- Central air- Jet tub- A decent size fenced in grassy yard on the side of the building (bike can be locked on the iron fence)- A guest street parking pass and plenty of street parking available, including two unzoned streets a block awayNEIGHBORHOOD AND LOCATION The neighborhood is small, residential, quiet and safe. Eckington is conveniently located in the heart of the city geographically. It's only 1.4 miles to Union Station, Capitol Hill, the National Mall, and all the Smithsonian museums, which is all easily within walking distance (or 1 metro stop – Union Station). The condo is also a 10 minute walk to DC's most useful red metro line (the stop is NoMa) and the walk is on a pedestrian/bike trail with no car traffic and a straight shot to the metro stop. In terms of transportation, besides being on the metro, the neighborhood is also a major city cycling area with the Metropolitan Branch Trail (connecting Union Station with Silver Spring and MD) running straight through it, together with several streets with bike lanes that connect directly to downtown, Dupont Circle and Georgetown. The city bike (Capital Bikeshare) sharing program also has several renting stations in the neighborhood, where you can check out bikes by the minute or by the hour.Although quiet and residential, Eckington is surrounded by two of the newest and most hip DC neighborhoods - NoMA and Bloomingdale. Both are within a 10 minute walk and offer a constantly growing number of coffee shops, restaurant and dining options, fast bites, bars, grocery stores, and various activities: BREAKFAST, BRUNCH, LUNCH, AND DINING• Big Bear café – probably the coolest joint around here, wind very crafty coffee, patio garden, and ever changing eclectic dinner menu on candle light (10-15 mins walk). • Windows café – easy neighborhood, deli type café (10-15 mins walk).• Grassroots Gourmet – a family bakery that uses fine ingredients to bake from scratch.• Rustic Tavern – great brick oven pizza and creative ingredients (10-15 mins walk).• Aroi Fine Thai and Japanese cuisine – traditional Thai and sushi (10-15 mins walk).• Bacio Pizzeria – great take out joint with excellent gourmet pizza (10-15 mins walk).• Beau Thai – modern Thai joint (15-20 mins walk).• Todd Gray's Watershed – an upscale, celebrity-chef restaurant (10-15 mins walk)• Fast bite options around the NoMA metro stop (15 mins walk):- 5 Guys burgers- Roti Mediterranean Grill- Au Bon Pain- Potbelly- Starbucks• *A Litteri – an authentic Italian grocer and deli with a mindblowing selection of wine, meats, olive oil, cheese, and anything Italian. They make great sandwiches too. This one is a true gem (15-20 min walk).• *Union Market – an old historic marketplace that has been recently renovated and is now one of the hippest gems in town and a serious rival to Eastern Market. It has and artisan feel and offers an original mix of meats, cheese, produce, seafood, bakery, smokery, creamery, Korean BBQ tacos, empanadas, olive oil, gelato, coffee, cupcakes, fine wine and beers, flowers (15-20 mins walk).• *Thai X-ing – probably the best and most famous Thai restaurant in the city, which is actually in the chef’s house and serves traditional home-style Thai recipes passed down from his family in an intimate home setting. Keep in mind that although it is not pretentious, reservations are a good idea, just because of the high traffic (25-30 mins walk). BARSBoundary Stone Public House – a very aesthetic neighborhood bar (but also popular all across the city) that offers crafted beers, an amazing bourbon list, and good food (10-15 mins walk).PHARMACY AND GROCERIES • McKinley Market – a small grocer/convenience store just around the corner (less than 5 min walk).• New Star Supermarket – a decent size neighborhood supermarket where you can find pretty much everything you need for cheap. It just hasn’t caught up with the organic/fancy food revolution yet – I am still a fan (10 mins walk).• Harris Teeter – the nicest grocery store around in terms of food quality and organic choices. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the NoMa metro).• Giant – a typical big American chain supermarket that offers everything and anything, generally cheaper than Harris Teeter. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the Rhode Island Ave metro).• Sunday farmers market by Big Bear Café.• CVS – two pharmacies, one by the NoMA metro and one by the Rhode Island Ave Metro (both 10-15 mins walk).SPORTS AND ACTIVITIESThere are multiple public sport facilities in the area, including indoor and outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, track, basketball courts, football and soccer fields, bike trails and city bike lanes, and the city’s only bike polo ground where pick-up games take place on Monday and Thursday night.• Harry Thomas Recreation Center – outdoor pool in the summer, gym, baseball field, tennis courts, basketball courts (10 mins walk).• McKinley Tech High School – football/soccer field and track (5 mins walk).• Trinity College - indoor Olympic pool (25 min walk)• Project Fitness Chickaro – gym and personal training (10 mins walk).• Brentwood Park – bike polo (20 min walk)ENTERTAINMENTIn terms of entertainment, the H Street Corridor/Atlas District and the U street area are both well known for their night life. Both are also 1.5 miles away, or a 30-40 minute walk. To all my reservations, I will email specific suggestions on DC gems and must-go places for live music, shows, night life, dining, pizza, crafty beer, coffee etc. that go beyond the neighborhood and explore the best of the city.",16.0,32,1,-77.00204948557584,32.0,1093,Real Bed,2,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/667954,38.91534616087834,Private room

,"Hello! This is a lovely bright studio in the heart of Dupont Circle. This is a great apartment on a quiet street in the heart of the city. You can walk to the White House and lots of fun restaurants from the apartment. I travel a lot for work so when I am gone, it is all yours. THE APARTMENT: A quiet studio on the fourth floor of a five story apartment building in Dupont Circle. The building has an elevator. The main room is 350 sq. feet but there is an additional walk-in closet, kitchen area, and bathroom. The room has a lovely view of some big trees next door. A full size bed is in the room and you will be provided with fresh sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner and soap.The bathroom has a full tub. And of course you could just use it for a shower. A hairdryer is also provided.There is a TV (without cable) in the room and a DVD player for your fun. There is also free WIFI. In addition there is obviously an air conditioner unit/fan and lots of heat.The refrigerator is small, for America, but it has certainly treated me well. Feel free to stock any small kitchen supplies. The stove/oven in the apartment was unplugged and so it does not function. The only kitchen appliance I do not have is an oven. You can boil water (or make anything) using the hot plates or you can use the slow cooker (Crock Pot) to make delicious food. There is a hotplate with two burners, a microwave, an electric can opener, a food processor, a crock pot (slow cooker) and a toaster that you should feel free to use. Most importantly - there is an espresso machine! I can also leave out my yoga mat for you. Just let me know. I have subscriptions to a lot of magazines such as Vogue, W, Glamour, Lucky, Vanity Fair, Fortune, Bloomberg Business Week, Budget Travel, People Style Watch, Travel & Leisure, etc. I have all the last four issues or so under my coffee table. Feel free to peruse through all the magazines.There are washing machines and dryers in the basement of my building. You can feel free to go down there and wash all your clothes. You have to buy a card for five dollars before you can wash anything. It is two dollars for a wash and 2.00 to dry. GUIDE BOOKS: I have a book of helpful information for your stay. It includes maps, information on local restaurants, helpful tips on the apartment, the neighborhood, etc. I also have the most recent version of the Lonely Planet DC guidebook and the Not For Tourists DC guidebook that you are more than welcome to use during your stay. So don't buy a guidebook if you stay here!THE LOCATION: Dupont Circle Area. The apartment is a five to ten minute walk from the Dupont Circle Metro Stop on the Red Line. You could also walk from the Green/Yellow Line's U-Street/African-American Civil War Memorial Stop but it would take about 20-25 minutes. The apartment building is located one building off of trendy 17th Street which is filled with restaurants, bars, nail salons, yogurt places, etc. A large grocery store is around the corner. Also there are two liquor stores and a 7-11 within feet of the apartment. From the apartment you could walk to the White House (about 20 minutes) or to the U-Street area (about 8 minutes) or Dupont Circle (about 5 minutes) or over to 14th Street (about 10 minutes). I repeat, within one block there is a 7-11 Convenience store, a supermarket, two liquor stores, a dry cleaner, numerous food options, a bar, etc. All sorts of fun!ACCESS: You can take the Metro's Red Line to Dupont Circle. From there it is a 5-10 minute walk. There are also numerous bus options available. Washington DC is a very walkable city and you can walk to the White House and other attractions easily from here. Perhaps more importantly, the area is overflowing with great restaurants!ROOMMATES: You will have the apartment to yourself. There are no roommates. I will just make sure to you have a key for the apartment. I have no dogs, cats, or pets of any kind. Please do not bring animals into the building. There is no smoking in the building. ROOM: The room will sleep two comfortably. There is full bed that is all yours. The orange sofa in the photos also can turn into a bed. I will provide clean sheets and towels. If three people wanted to stay, two people could sleep in the bed and one person could sleep on the futon. The futon is not super comfortable though so I would not recommend an older person or anyone with back problems sleep on the futon. I think young people travelling with friends or small children would not mind sleeping on the futon. EXTRAS:Hair Dryer, Wifi, TV, DVD Player, Toaster, Crock Pot, Yoga Mat, Espresso Machine, Microwave, Shampoo, Conditioner, Soap & Clean Towels. I also have an HDMI cable if you want to hook it into your laptop you can watch movies through it on my TV.PARKING: DC is not a car friendly city. The apartment is a 5-10 minute walk to the Dupont Circle Metro stop. The apartment is also on many major bus routes. If you really want to bring your car, you can park it on the street on weekends and holidays but PLEASE pay attention to the street signs. Parking tickets in DC usually run around $100. If I had a car here, I would not risk worrying about street parking and I would park in one of the nearby garages. There is a parking garage at 17th and P Street where you can park your car for $16 a day. The garage is a five minute walk from my apartment.CHECK IN/CHECK OUT: I have a flexible checkin/checkout time listed. It makes sense to me to be as flexible as possible to allow guests the best stay! That said, please try to check in around 2pm (or later). And please try to check out by noon (or earlier). This ensures a smooth process for everyone. That said, please let me know before your arrival when you plan to arrive and when you plan to check out. The Airbnb calendar is accurate through Mid-October 2013. (Except for Nov.25-Dec.2 and Dec. 18-28, New Years & Feb. 7-14th you can book then :-) If you need to stay an extra day or two that are not available on the calendar, just let me know. It should work out. Thanks so much!",19.333333333333332,58,1,-77.03875943013817,58.0,856,Real Bed,3,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/223032,38.91304809335995,Entire home/flat

,"Hello! This is a new sweet DC themed studio apartment in the heart of the city in the wonderfully fun Dupont Circle neighborhood. This is a great apartment on a quiet street and you can walk to the White House and lots of fun restaurants from the apartment. THE APARTMENT: A quiet studio in an apartment building in Dupont Circle. The building has an elevator. The main room is 350 sq. feet but there is an additional closet, kitchen area, and bathroom. NEIGHBORHOOD: If you don't know much about DC, let me tell you that Dupont Circle is the best neighborhood in town. The rent here has reached the same levels as in Manhattan in NYC and when an apartment is open in the area, it gets snatched up in a second. Tree lined streets, amazing restaurants, hip bars and a big grocery store are within one block of the apartment and I hope you can experience it by staying here! The neighborhood is extremely safe, the shops are cute, the people are nice, the bars are fun and you can walk to the White House and all of downtown. It's pretty much everything you could ask for in this town. This may not be the biggest apartment on Airbnb in DC but it just may be the one in the best location. A QUEEN SIZE BED is in the room and you will be provided with fresh sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner and soap.The bathroom has a full tub. And of course you could just use it for a shower. A hairdryer is provided.There is free WIFI. In addition there is obviously an air conditioner unit/fan and lots of heat. There is no TV. There is a large refrigerator. Feel free to stock up and store any food or anything you need in the kitchen. The stove/oven in the apartment are ready for you to use. There is a microwave! There is a toaster! There is a coffee machine! There are six wine glasses and six regular glasses! There are also six regular size plates and six little plates all for you. And three fun mugs. And martini glasses! And shot glasses! Yay!There are washing machines and dryers in the basement of my building. You can feel free to go down there and wash all your clothes. You have to buy a card for five dollars before you can wash anything. It is two dollars for a wash and two dollars to dry.I have a book of helpful information for your stay. It includes maps, information on local restaurants, helpful tips on the apartment, etc. I also have the most recent Lonely Planet DC city guide for you so don't buy a guidebook if you stay here!THE LOCATION: Dupont Circle Area. The apartment is a five to ten minute walk from the Dupont Circle Metro Stop on the Red Line. You could also walk from the Green/Yellow Line's U-Street/African-American Civil War Memorial Stop but it would take about 20-25 minutes. The apartment building is located one building off of trendy 17th Street which is filled with restaurants, bars, nail salons, yogurt places, etc. A large grocery store is around the corner. Also there are two liquor stores and a 7-11 within feet of the apartment. From the apartment you could walk to the White House (about 20 minutes) or to the U-Street area (about 8 minutes) or Dupont Circle (about 5 minutes) or over to 14th Street (about 10 minutes). I repeat, within one block there is a 7-11 Convenience store, a supermarket, two liquor stores, a dry cleaner, numerous food options, a bar, etc. All sorts of fun!ACCESS: You can take the Metro's Red Line to Dupont Circle. From there it is a 5-10 minute walk. There are also numerous bus options available. Washington DC is a very walkable city and you can walk to the White House and other attractions easily from here. Perhaps more importantly, the area is overflowing with great restaurants!ROOMMATES: You will have the apartment to yourself. There are no roommates. I will just make sure to you have two sets of keys to the apartment. I have no dogs, cats, or pets of any kind. Please do not bring animals into the building. There is no smoking in the building.ROOM: The room will sleep two comfortably in the amazing queen bed. You could also put an additional third person on the futon. Woohoo! I will provide clean sheets and towels.EXTRAS: Hair Dryer, Wifi, Coffee Pot, Toaster, Microwave, Shampoo, Conditioner, Soap, Clean Towels, Iron, Ironing Board, Playing Cards, Lonely Planet Washington DC - all sorts of fun.BED: QUEEN (!!!) bed. Yay! FUTON: The futon is the blue couch pictured. You just press it back and it turns into a bed. Full Disclosure - This futon is from Target (like Ikea) and it is a reliable futon but not the world's most comfortable. I wouldn't tell my mother to sleep here but I think most of my 20 something friends would not mind sleeping on the futon. IRON: There is an iron and an ironing board in the apartment. Please feel free to use it. PARKING: DC is not a car friendly city. The apartment is a 5-10 minute walk to the Dupont Circle Metro stop. The apartment is also on many major bus routes. If you really want to bring your car, you can park it on the street for free on weekends and holidays but PLEASE pay attention to the street signs. Parking tickets in DC usually run around $100. If I had a car here, I would not risk worrying about street parking and I would park in one of the nearby garages. There is a parking garage at 17th and P Street where you can park your car for $16 a day. The garage is a five minute walk from my apartment. Many guests have kept their car there while staying at my place. CHECK IN/CHECK OUT: I have a flexible checkin/checkout time listed. It makes sense to me to be as flexible as possible to allow guests the best stay! That said, please try to check in after 2pm (or later) and please try to leave before noon (or earlier). If you need to check in earlier or check out later, let me know. It will probably work out!

For my guests to offer, I also have two metro Smart Trip cards (rechargeable chip-cards that also give you a slight discount on the metro fare), a visitors parking pass for free daily street parking in front of my building (in case you drive), and the possibility of bike rentals through me (to be discussed on a case by case basis). Also, when you rent just a room, don’t be concerned about sharing with strangers. I don’t operate as a hostel – this is my home, I live her, and I only rent my guest bedroom (one at a time), while I live in the other. So you do get to share with me as the host, but that’s it – no in and out traffic, no strangers. Washington D.C. has two faces – Washington the Nation’s Capitol, and D.C. as the city itself. The Nation’s Capitol has the well known historic and government landmarks and museums (Capitol Building, Library of Congress, the White House, the Supreme Court, the Smithsonian Museums, the National Cathedral, the national monuments, etc.). When you book with me, I would help you get beyond the Nation’s Capitol and discover the other face of D.C. – the city and its vibrant neighborhoods, cultural and nightlife, thriving restaurant scene, farmers markets, and a good number of creative places that offer an eclectic selection of crafty coffee making, microbrews (and microbrew imports), and rare spirits from small badge bourbon and scotch distilleries. Also to clarify, guests are often confused by the name “AirBnB” and inquire with me about breakfast provided, rides to/from the airport, and sightseeing tours around the city. AirBnB is al bed and breakfast only in name and only virtually. The only thing I offer is affordable accommodation, good hosting and some good suggestions to make your experience in DC real good. Well, I also do offer to my guests all the tea and coffee in the house, and often when I am prepared, I will treat them to wine and beer. The rest is up to you and I could only help with ideas.THE APARTMENTMy place to share is a modern two bedroom condo on the second floor in a small 4 unit building. I have a separate listing for the whole apartment, but I also rent the rooms separately to low-key travelers on a budget. The guest bedroom listed here is the smaller of the two and has a queen size futon. The apartment has one bathroom (that we share), a fully equipped modern kitchen, and a large wooden deck with patio furniture and a propane grill. The apartment is clean, tidy, well-maintained, and non-smoking home. A couple of other features include:- Wireless Internet- TV and cable- PS3 with a Netflix account and a DVD/Blu-Ray player (and FIFA 2013 if you care hahaha)- A laptop-to-TV video and sound connectors- A stereo with 2 ceiling and 2 stand-alone speakers- Washer and dryer in unit- Dishwasher- Central air- Jet tub- A decent size fenced in grassy yard on the side of the building (bike can be locked on the iron fence)- A guest street parking pass and plenty of street parking available, including two unzoned streets a block awayNEIGHBORHOOD AND LOCATION The neighborhood is small, residential, quiet and safe. Eckington is conveniently located in the heart of the city geographically. It's only 1.4 miles to Union Station, Capitol Hill, the National Mall, and all the Smithsonian museums, which is all easily within walking distance (or 1 metro stop – Union Station). The condo is also a 10 minute walk to DC's most useful red metro line (the stop is NoMa) and the walk is on a pedestrian/bike trail with no car traffic and a straight shot to the metro stop. In terms of transportation, besides being on the metro, the neighborhood is also a major city cycling area with the Metropolitan Branch Trail (connecting Union Station with Silver Spring and MD) running straight through it, together with several streets with bike lanes that connect directly to downtown, Dupont Circle and Georgetown. The city bike (Capital Bikeshare) sharing program also has several renting stations in the neighborhood, where you can check out bikes by the minute or by the hour.Although quiet and residential, Eckington is surrounded by two of the newest and most hip DC neighborhoods - NoMA and Bloomingdale. Both are within a 10 minute walk and offer a constantly growing number of coffee shops, restaurant and dining options, fast bites, bars, grocery stores, and various activities: BREAKFAST, BRUNCH, LUNCH, AND DINING• Big Bear café – probably the coolest joint around here, wind very crafty coffee, patio garden, and ever changing eclectic dinner menu on candle light (10-15 mins walk). • Windows café – easy neighborhood, deli type café (10-15 mins walk).• Grassroots Gourmet – a family bakery that uses fine ingredients to bake from scratch.• Rustic Tavern – great brick oven pizza and creative ingredients (10-15 mins walk).• Aroi Fine Thai and Japanese cuisine – traditional Thai and sushi (10-15 mins walk).• Bacio Pizzeria – great take out joint with excellent gourmet pizza (10-15 mins walk).• Beau Thai – modern Thai joint (15-20 mins walk).• Todd Gray's Watershed – an upscale, celebrity-chef restaurant (10-15 mins walk)• Fast bite options around the NoMA metro stop (15 mins walk):- 5 Guys burgers- Roti Mediterranean Grill- Au Bon Pain- Potbelly- Starbucks• *A Litteri – an authentic Italian grocer and deli with a mindblowing selection of wine, meats, olive oil, cheese, and anything Italian. They make great sandwiches too. This one is a true gem (15-20 min walk).• *Union Market – an old historic marketplace that has been recently renovated and is now one of the hippest gems in town and a serious rival to Eastern Market. It has and artisan feel and offers an original mix of meats, cheese, produce, seafood, bakery, smokery, creamery, Korean BBQ tacos, empanadas, olive oil, gelato, coffee, cupcakes, fine wine and beers, flowers (15-20 mins walk).• *Thai X-ing – probably the best and most famous Thai restaurant in the city, which is actually in the chef’s house and serves traditional home-style Thai recipes passed down from his family in an intimate home setting. Keep in mind that although it is not pretentious, reservations are a good idea, just because of the high traffic (25-30 mins walk). BARSBoundary Stone Public House – a very aesthetic neighborhood bar (but also popular all across the city) that offers crafted beers, an amazing bourbon list, and good food (10-15 mins walk).PHARMACY AND GROCERIES • McKinley Market – a small grocer/convenience store just around the corner (less than 5 min walk).• New Star Supermarket – a decent size neighborhood supermarket where you can find pretty much everything you need for cheap. It just hasn’t caught up with the organic/fancy food revolution yet – I am still a fan (10 mins walk).• Harris Teeter – the nicest grocery store around in terms of food quality and organic choices. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the NoMa metro).• Giant – a typical big American chain supermarket that offers everything and anything, generally cheaper than Harris Teeter. It also has a rich food bar and bakery with numerous of breakfast, lunch and dinner choices (15 mins walk, it’s by the Rhode Island Ave metro).• Sunday farmers market by Big Bear Café.• CVS – two pharmacies, one by the NoMA metro and one by the Rhode Island Ave Metro (both 10-15 mins walk).SPORTS AND ACTIVITIESThere are multiple public sport facilities in the area, including indoor and outdoor swimming pool, tennis courts, track, basketball courts, football and soccer fields, bike trails and city bike lanes, and the city’s only bike polo ground where pick-up games take place on Monday and Thursday night.• Harry Thomas Recreation Center – outdoor pool in the summer, gym, baseball field, tennis courts, basketball courts (10 mins walk).• McKinley Tech High School – football/soccer field and track (5 mins walk).• Trinity College - indoor Olympic pool (25 min walk)• Project Fitness Chickaro – gym and personal training (10 mins walk).• Brentwood Park – bike polo (20 min walk)ENTERTAINMENTIn terms of entertainment, the H Street Corridor/Atlas District and the U street area are both well known for their night life. Both are also 1.5 miles away, or a 30-40 minute walk. To all my reservations, I will email specific suggestions on DC gems and must-go places for live music, shows, night life, dining, pizza, crafty beer, coffee etc. that go beyond the neighborhood and explore the best of the city.",16.0,32,1,-77.00204948557584,32.0,1093,Real Bed,2,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/667954,38.91534616087834,Private room

,"Hello! This is a lovely bright studio in the heart of Dupont Circle. This is a great apartment on a quiet street in the heart of the city. You can walk to the White House and lots of fun restaurants from the apartment. I travel a lot for work so when I am gone, it is all yours. THE APARTMENT: A quiet studio on the fourth floor of a five story apartment building in Dupont Circle. The building has an elevator. The main room is 350 sq. feet but there is an additional walk-in closet, kitchen area, and bathroom. The room has a lovely view of some big trees next door. A full size bed is in the room and you will be provided with fresh sheets, towels, shampoo, conditioner and soap.The bathroom has a full tub. And of course you could just use it for a shower. A hairdryer is also provided.There is a TV (without cable) in the room and a DVD player for your fun. There is also free WIFI. In addition there is obviously an air conditioner unit/fan and lots of heat.The refrigerator is small, for America, but it has certainly treated me well. Feel free to stock any small kitchen supplies. The stove/oven in the apartment was unplugged and so it does not function. The only kitchen appliance I do not have is an oven. You can boil water (or make anything) using the hot plates or you can use the slow cooker (Crock Pot) to make delicious food. There is a hotplate with two burners, a microwave, an electric can opener, a food processor, a crock pot (slow cooker) and a toaster that you should feel free to use. Most importantly - there is an espresso machine! I can also leave out my yoga mat for you. Just let me know. I have subscriptions to a lot of magazines such as Vogue, W, Glamour, Lucky, Vanity Fair, Fortune, Bloomberg Business Week, Budget Travel, People Style Watch, Travel & Leisure, etc. I have all the last four issues or so under my coffee table. Feel free to peruse through all the magazines.There are washing machines and dryers in the basement of my building. You can feel free to go down there and wash all your clothes. You have to buy a card for five dollars before you can wash anything. It is two dollars for a wash and 2.00 to dry. GUIDE BOOKS: I have a book of helpful information for your stay. It includes maps, information on local restaurants, helpful tips on the apartment, the neighborhood, etc. I also have the most recent version of the Lonely Planet DC guidebook and the Not For Tourists DC guidebook that you are more than welcome to use during your stay. So don't buy a guidebook if you stay here!THE LOCATION: Dupont Circle Area. The apartment is a five to ten minute walk from the Dupont Circle Metro Stop on the Red Line. You could also walk from the Green/Yellow Line's U-Street/African-American Civil War Memorial Stop but it would take about 20-25 minutes. The apartment building is located one building off of trendy 17th Street which is filled with restaurants, bars, nail salons, yogurt places, etc. A large grocery store is around the corner. Also there are two liquor stores and a 7-11 within feet of the apartment. From the apartment you could walk to the White House (about 20 minutes) or to the U-Street area (about 8 minutes) or Dupont Circle (about 5 minutes) or over to 14th Street (about 10 minutes). I repeat, within one block there is a 7-11 Convenience store, a supermarket, two liquor stores, a dry cleaner, numerous food options, a bar, etc. All sorts of fun!ACCESS: You can take the Metro's Red Line to Dupont Circle. From there it is a 5-10 minute walk. There are also numerous bus options available. Washington DC is a very walkable city and you can walk to the White House and other attractions easily from here. Perhaps more importantly, the area is overflowing with great restaurants!ROOMMATES: You will have the apartment to yourself. There are no roommates. I will just make sure to you have a key for the apartment. I have no dogs, cats, or pets of any kind. Please do not bring animals into the building. There is no smoking in the building. ROOM: The room will sleep two comfortably. There is full bed that is all yours. The orange sofa in the photos also can turn into a bed. I will provide clean sheets and towels. If three people wanted to stay, two people could sleep in the bed and one person could sleep on the futon. The futon is not super comfortable though so I would not recommend an older person or anyone with back problems sleep on the futon. I think young people travelling with friends or small children would not mind sleeping on the futon. EXTRAS:Hair Dryer, Wifi, TV, DVD Player, Toaster, Crock Pot, Yoga Mat, Espresso Machine, Microwave, Shampoo, Conditioner, Soap & Clean Towels. I also have an HDMI cable if you want to hook it into your laptop you can watch movies through it on my TV.PARKING: DC is not a car friendly city. The apartment is a 5-10 minute walk to the Dupont Circle Metro stop. The apartment is also on many major bus routes. If you really want to bring your car, you can park it on the street on weekends and holidays but PLEASE pay attention to the street signs. Parking tickets in DC usually run around $100. If I had a car here, I would not risk worrying about street parking and I would park in one of the nearby garages. There is a parking garage at 17th and P Street where you can park your car for $16 a day. The garage is a five minute walk from my apartment.CHECK IN/CHECK OUT: I have a flexible checkin/checkout time listed. It makes sense to me to be as flexible as possible to allow guests the best stay! That said, please try to check in around 2pm (or later). And please try to check out by noon (or earlier). This ensures a smooth process for everyone. That said, please let me know before your arrival when you plan to arrive and when you plan to check out. The Airbnb calendar is accurate through Mid-October 2013. (Except for Nov.25-Dec.2 and Dec. 18-28, New Years & Feb. 7-14th you can book then :-) If you need to stay an extra day or two that are not available on the calendar, just let me know. It should work out. Thanks so much!",19.333333333333332,58,1,-77.03875943013817,58.0,856,Real Bed,3,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/223032,38.91304809335995,Entire home/flat

,"Hello! We live 5 miles from the White House in an older, nice, established neighborhood. Parking is free, on a safe street less then twenty-feet from your private bedroom door with separate entrance, and your own half-bath in the room. We are about 7-10 minute walk (if you're a zippy walker; 10-15 minute if you're not) to the Takoma, Metro Station, on the Red Line. Buses run up and down Georgia Avenue for easy access to downtown DC or Silver Spring. Silver Spring is about a mile away, has a Whole Foods grocery store, and many restaurants, as well as the Fillmore Music Stage, AFI Silver Movie Theatre, The Discovery Channel HQ, NOAA, and more. There is a Safeway grocery store a half-mile away. We are about a mile from Old Town Takoma Park, Maryland; it has a year 'round Farmer's Market and excellent restaurants and shops. The room we offer has a Full Bed. The room could sleep two small children on the floor as well, although it would be cramped. The floor is hardwood. It has a door directly to the porch You have easy entry and exit without going through the main house. The room has an enclosed bathroom, with sink and toilet, and offers privacy. The room has a door that effectively closes the room off to the rest of the house, insuring complete privacy. The room does *NOT* have a shower. We only have a shower upstairs, although, of course, you are welcome to use the shower whenever you'd like and at any hour. During the warm months the room has an air-conditioner you control as you like. The room has a small refrigerator as well. We do not allow Kitchen use, or Cooking in the Kitchen. The house is simply not large enough, as we both work from home often, and need that space to work in. We don't a have a curfew or “hours.” Come and go as you please.

To give some distances: two blocks from Walter Reed Medical Center; 1.2 miles to downtown Silver Spring (including a Whole Foods and Super Giant); 1/2 mile to Safeway grocery store; 3/4 mile to “downtown” Takoma Park (Sunday Farmer’s market year-round); Takoma Metro (Red Line) is a 7 minute walk, and about a 12 minute ride to Union Station, across the the Capitol Dome; 4.5 miles to University of Maryland, College Park; 5.4 miles to the White House; 3.5 miles to Bethesda.

DC has been transformed, for the better, by Zip Car; Car2Go car-share; and Capital Bike Share. Consider getting a Car2Go membership BEFORE you get here. It is usually free, and we know many of the free passwords to use when joining -- just contact us for help. Car2Go needs to process your driver's license, so you need the lead time for them to send you the Car2Go card....which can't happen if you're already here. Car2Go is true car sharing: you drive it one-way and walk away. It is fairly cheap, easy, relaxing, and fast. Parking is free in DC; and everything is included for $0.38 cents a minute; up to a maximum of $14.00 per hour. Consider that against the cost of Metro at peak fare. And the time you'll save. You do need a smart phone or WIFI to get the app to see where the Car2Go cars are -- they are scattered all over the city, and constantly moving around the city as they are used. When you're done with your trip you park the car where you want to, and walk away. Beautiful...Capital Bike Share is for real as transportation. If you can ride a bike consider joining BEFORE you get here: they will send you a plastic key that is used at the docks where you get the bikes, and then you can pay as you use. This is a NEW feature of BikeShare, and it makes this service even easier to use.We are a bicycle family. If you can bring your own bike to DC consider doing so. Getting around by bicycle is a great way to enjoy DC. We can help with all manner of bicycle-related questions, including repair, routes and sites to see. Free, on-site bike storage.

You share with me a roommate-style 2 Bedroom/1 Bath condo with ample-sized bedroom. (I have recently changed furniture and have not taken new photos yet.) *Your payment includes self-serve breakfast, satellite TV in your room, and wireless internet. *Since I am absent a lot, my place is best for independent travelers.

Just minutes to the metro, Convention Center, Georgetown Law, shops, restaurant/bars, and theaters. A safe area, cabs available around the clock, and bus stops nearby. Perfect! A cute, relaxing room with a helpful, accommodating host (and her dog) in the heart of D.C.This is a perfect location for people wanting to take advantage of the walkability of D.C. The room is cute and very comfortable, AND you'll be close to all the action (the Hill, the National Mall, museums, galleries, bars, restaurants, shops, etc)!If you are home, there is wifi in the apartment, but no TV at this time. The building has a small gym with treadmills, elliptical machines and weights. The real highlight, though, is the stunning roof deck sporting a seasonal pool overlooking the Washington Monument, downtown DC, and Congress. It's a wonderful place to sip a glass of wine and relax after a day of walking. (Important: The pool closes at the end of September, the deck remains open all year.) Finally, I provide cereal, pancake mix, eggs, maple syrup, and a selection of coffees and teas so you can have a leisurely morning having breakfast on the roof if you so choose. I don't make the breakfast (since I'm usually running out the door to class), but feel to help yourself!Guests will have a private room and an attached private (full) bathroom. The kitchen and living room are shared with me and my rather shy dog. I may be busy, but I will always try to greet the guest and offer any tips as needed. And I am always a phone call/email/text away!My dog stays in the apartment when I am gone, usually in a crate in my room. There is a chance you might hear her a little if you're in the living room, but she shouldn't be too loud.The neighborhood -- Chinatown -- is convenient to almost all of the city due to the numerous metro stops in the area. It's a safe place, with a ton of bars, restaurants, shops, a giant movie theater, etc. I feel safe walking home at night as there are always people out and it's well lit. This is a newer part of DC, so you're not going to see the beautiful old row houses and such. They're only a short walk away, but it is a modern downtown neighborhood. This location is SUPER convenient to public transportation! The Circulator stops right in front of the building and will take you to the Georgetown neighborhood, or it's a short walk to the Gallery Place Metro (green, yellow, red lines) and the Metro Center stop (red, orange, blue lines). Finally, it's only about a 15-20 minute walk (or very short bus/cab ride) from Union Station. Oh, and if you're flying into DCA (Reagan Int'l Airport), just hop on the metro and get off at Gallery Place! It's only a few dollars and very quick! Just to reiterate, I have a dog. She's has short-hair, is sweet and doesn't have an aggressive bone in her body ... but she is a dog and I can't promise to predict everything she will do. So please be an animal lover and understand that even wonderful dogs sometimes have accidents or do weird things like get in the garbage or something. And if you're allergic to dogs, this probably isn't the place for you since, try as I might to prevent it, she does shed.",35.5,71,1,-77.01808723193358,71.0,862,Real Bed,2,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1285129,38.90141449509797,Private room

,"I believe that everyone who visits the Nations Capital should have an affordable, secure, comfortable, extremely large, beautiful place to stay. It brings me great joy to make this wonderful condo unit available for your staying pleasure. I also believe you should have a private place to say, your own place for a period of time, while you are traveling - just like your home. I really appreciate all of the guests who have stayed with us this past year and they really appreciate the hospitality, the large basement condo suite and how close it is to the attractions. If you want your own place at an affordable price than read on..This is a very large (1400 SQ feet) beautiful remodeled basement condo that has two bedrooms, each with a full sized bed, one bath, a private living room area, washer/dryer, an eat-in kitchen area, cable TV, and wireless Internet. Wow! It's has two private entrance ways (one in the rear and the other is on the side) so you can come and go as you please - just like your home.. Includes all utilities. Sleeps six people with one person sleeping on the couch and the other sleeping on the sofa bed (in a private living room), the other four would sleep in the two bed rooms. The below ground condo suite is close to the Brookland/CU Metro on the Red line which is the best public transportation system I've seen in a while comparable to other large cities. Now, our Metro system is not perfect by any means, but it is the best of what I've seen based on some other transit systems in large cities in the US and abroad. When using the Metro bus and train it's best to travel during rush hour. Why? Because ""mass transit"" systems work more efficiently when you are moving a ""mass"" or large number of people. There are more buses and subway trains running more frequently. It does not work as effectively for the individuals during the day. So travel times to the City center can vary greatly based on when you are traveling. The key is that the Metro system has schedules that can be used to minimize your wait time. The suite is about 1.2 miles to the Brookland/CU metro station, 3 miles to Capitol Hill and 4.5 miles to the White House. Off street parking is available if you are driving. Just bring your tooth brush and your ability to have fun in Washington, DC - Of course all the towels and linens will be provided.Special Offers: If I make you a special offer it will only be available for 48 hours. This will ensure on those very rare occasions that over booking does not happen. We have updated to the best sleep system available - memory foam toppers and pillows. We recognize that sleep is one of the most important part of your stay so we have taken special attention in this area to make sure that your stay during the night is extremely comfortable and restful. If you don't sleep well at night then it's going to be hard to function and have fun during the day. Why do we constantly continue to make these small improvements? We want you to sleep so conformable that when you leave your review - it's gonna be all about how well you slept. As one biker guest from the state of Georgia said in his southern drawl at checkout, ""You are lucky that I don't have my pickup truck here because I would back it up to the door and take that bed and mattress back to Georgia with me"". I'm going to have to get a new bed when I get back home.""We are working harder for you so we are now offering an airport pickup and grocery paid services. Some guest would like to just show up and have the refrigerator stocked with the food, that they like to cook and eat. If you don't have a car and you don't want to use public transportation to get your groceries, just let us know and we will do the shopping for you. Or, we don't mind taking you to the grocery store or to Radio Shack (to pickup that international plug for your laptop that you left in back in Europe) if you need to go. Thank you (website hidden) travelers for making us number one in Washington, DC in the four or more guests category. We really appreciate your appreciation of the condo suite. We also appreciate your feedback on how to make the basement Condo suite even better. So here are some of the things that we have done based on your wonderful suggestions: We have added an electric frying pan so you can cook, in addition to the existing Microwave, George Foreman Grill, egg / omelet grill, toaster oven, and coffee maker. We have also added a HP LaserJet 4 Printer so you can print out your airline boarding pass. We really love the reliable HP LaserJet 4, you will too. The only thing that I can not fix is that for some reason AT&T cellular phone service is really spotty in the basement. There have been several guest who all have AT&T cell phone service and their calls go to voice mail. Interestingly, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon work very well. For the young and the young at heart, we have added throwback board games such as Monopoly, Trouble, Battle Ship and a Chess board / pieces. We really like young at hearts. We have installed a garbage disposal, more towel racks in the bathroom and a silent toilet bowel lid - so when your family member or friend closes the lid in the bathroom it won't disturb you or the other guests outside of the bathroom. So a hardy ""Thank You"" to all the guests who have graced us with your wonderful presence and made super fantastic suggestions. Being number one in one category is great but it is not good enough. We want guest who are traveling either singularly or as couples to be able to enjoy this wonderful suite. Okay, so here is the deal: If you are a single traveler and you want to say in only only one bedroom then send me an email and let's talk about the price. If the basement condo is free then why not talk about it and see what we can work out. Peace and blessings,Anthony******PS Please note that room rates can change daily or weekly based on supply and demand. It is all about the Economics! Room rate do not change after you have booked unless you are adding guest or extending your stay. What I've found is that you can get better room rates if you book one or two months before your arrival dates. I just hate it when I don't have guest to enjoy this wonderful place. Book with confidence - Oh, yea check out our feedback. ******",6.111111111111111,55,2,-76.979469,27.5,1391,Real Bed,9,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/4002,38.945518,Entire home/flat

,"Large, clean, bedroom with full bed and shared bath. This is the original master bedroom of a traditional DC rowhouse. The house is cozy as a cottage with an eclectic mix of antique and foreign furniture and decorations, features heart pine floors throughout and a footed tub with Italian marble in the bathroom. There is both a front porch and back garden that you are welcome to relax in. The room comes with free WiFi, a closet, dresser, hair dryer, iron (and, of course, sheets and towels) and the use of the washer/dryer. I also have a housekeeper who comes every two weeks. I am an urban planner focusing on bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure and renovated most of the house myself. I am happy to provide you with maps and information about the city and will join you for a glass of evening wine on the porch or give you your privacy, as you prefer. I have two cats – one friendlier than the other- who are truly entertaining. The neighborhood: My home is located in the Edgewood neighborhood of DC. Upon first blush, most people see it as quite rough around the edges, but the business owners and neighbors are all very friendly. The neighborhood was once the estate of Salmon P. Chase: statesman, abolitionist and jurist. The neighborhood arose with the establishment of the Metropolitan Branch Line of the C&O Railroad in 1873. This line now includes the Metropolitan Branch Trail (a biking and walking trail) and the red line of the metro (subway). Within a few blocks are grocery stores, dry cleaners, drug stores, etc. A 15-min walk takes to you the heart of Bloomingdale, where you will find great places to eat, a yoga studio, and a thriving farmer’s market during the summer and fall. Getting around: Edgewood is only 1.5 miles from Union Station and downtown DC – about a 30 minute walk. DC is a wonderful place to walk and most things are within a pleasant walking distance. Metro (subway): Rhode Island Ave metro station (red line) is an 8 minute walk. Trains run every 3-6 minutes. Bus: the G8 (to Chinatown and Dupont area) the D8 (to Union Station/the Mall) pick up at my corner. Buses run every 10 minutes at rush hour during the week. Bike: the Met Branch Trail will take you to Union Station/the Mall. You can rent ""Capital BikeShare"" bikes by the hour. Pick up two blocks away. Car-sharing: Zip cars are located nearby and a CarToGo is usually located in the neighborhood. On street parking is available (though vehicles must be moved on street-sweeping days). Private parking is available for an additional $10 per day.Other than general respectfulness, some simple rules:1. Please provide names of all guests.2. On the weekend, check-in after 2 pm & Check-out before 11 am. During the week, due to my work schedule, I can typically only check in guests before 9am or after 6pm (sorry).3. No parties or outside overnight guests (other than pre-approved guests).4.

It has its own ingress (front door) and egress (back door) and is located beneath our Capitol Hill rowhome. We're a family of five: two adults and our three recently-adopted foster children, ages 3, 4, and 7. As we live above the apartment, you will hear us -- and we will likely hear you.

We're less than 1 block from the Eastern Market Metro (you can see it from the front door!), and 1-4 blocks from numerous restaurants, bars, coffeeshops, etc. (on Pennsylvania Ave., SE as well as 8th Street SE, aka ""Barracks Row"").

The apartment has CFLs, a dual-flush toilet, Pella windows, and a Nest Learning Thermostat. Additionally, the electricity is sourced from local wind farms through Clean Currents. We're in the process of slowly phasing out our regular cleaning supplies for more environmentally-friendly products. Additionally, as DC can be hot and sticky and swampy in the summer, we have a mosquito service that comes every two weeks to spray for mosquitoes in our front yard and our back yard.

,"This two and half bedroom house is in a residential neighborhood of Capitol Hill, six blocks from the metro (Orange and Blue line), and two blocks from a major grocery store. The house has central air, wifi, gas for cooking, and plenty of street parking. Historic Eastern Market, the second oldest open air market built in 1805 is seven blocks west which is perfect for picking up fresh veggies at the farmer's market and getting Maryland crab sandwiches. I'm a great host too and will greet you when you arrive and retreat if you want space or can chat a bit. You will stay in the guest bedroom with a private attached office which has wifi, closet space, and a super comfortable log bed. You are welcome to come to the gym with me as my quest if that interests you (Apparently an individual guest can come once a month for free). I have the best gym (e.g. three floors or room to work out, hot tub, and sauna). The house has new hard wood floors, stainless steel appliances and was recently renovated. There is a little patio out in the back and a front porch. If you want to feel what real Capitol Hill neighborhood is like--this is it. It should be noted that a little crepe shop just opened one-a-half blocks away and the Capitol is one-and-half mile away! A Capitol Bike Share stand hosts rental bikes one block away where you can rent bikes that is open 24/7 Check out: (website hidden)_downtownDC.pdfYou have a private bathroom with your room. Parking If you need a parking permit I can obtain a residential guest parking permit but I have to pick it up at the Police Station. The parking is free if you give me your license plate number but I charge a $25 fee to pick it up the permit (one flat rate). Hotels charge $30 a day for parking. You can park for free on weekends and holidays without a parking pass but will get a ticket if you park without a permit for more than two hours on weekdays or when games are going on the stadium. Location: My house is a mile point two on foot to the Capitol building, accessible by metro by Reagan airport or a 15 minute cab ride from there. From Baltimore I am 38 miles away and you can take the metro here from there too on the Green metro line. From Dulles Airport here are your options:1) Cab: A cab costs about $65 and is fastest. Cash or credit card. 2) Washington flyer: This bus leaves Dulles airport every half hour on the quarter hour and takes you to Metro station where you can finish your trip on the Orange or Blue line east to Potomac metro. Cost: $9 for the bus fare and about $2.85 for the metro ride at peak hour. (website hidden)_bus_schedule.htm. This way is second fastest. Buy tickets inside the airport at a stand. 3) 5A Municipal bus. Many professionals who travel for business take this. It leaves from the airport every half hour on the quarter hour also. It costs $6 and takes you to L'Enfant plaza where you take the Orange or Blue line east to Potomac metro. (website hidden) This is the best value for your money and takes about ten minutes more than Option #2. Cash only/Exact change required. 4) Super shuttle: $35 (website hidden)_shuttle.htm This is my least favorite option for the money as Capitol Hill East is the farthermost of neighborhoods on the Hill from Dulles and they drop you off last. I don't recommend this option. 5) Union Station: Take the D6 bus (time table here: (website hidden)) and request to stop at Massachusetts and 17th Street. Walk towards D & 15th Street, SE. Make sure you are walking in the right direction as East Capitol is the dividing line between NE and SE. Don't walk to D Street NE (common mistake)Beds: The bed in this master guest room is a queen sized bed. The mattress, before I bought my house, was the second most expensive thing I owned. It is a premium mattress. The second bed in the study/den is a twin bed that pulls-out from the love seat. The sofa bed is new (purchased in May 2012). I put a thick foam topper on it and mattress pad. If you need the second bed made please tell me in advance. It is $10 per reservation with advanced planning and $15 a night if you need it and fail to mention it. Safety: My neighborhood is safe. I've lived on Capitol Hill for seven years and never felt unsafe. Continental Breakfast: Consists of orange juice, a pastry and a banana or other piece of fruit and hot tea. Sometimes I make eggs and tortillas available for your use. (website hidden) Maps: AirBnB's (website hidden) Street view maps is not working. Here is the corrected link: (website hidden) My house is light green and behind the tree (Note: Tree was knocked down during Hurricane Irene).Bonus offer: Thinking about becoming a host on AirBnB or think you know someone who should be a host? I am a designated AirBnB ambassador and offer this unique promo code where new hosts get a $50 bonus. Use this promo code when starting a new account and a listing and we both get $50: ZB9QQDCommunications: I prefer to use AirBnB's site for our communications. Why? Sometimes guests email goes to my spam. Sometimes guests link a secondary email and do not check it (I am very good at communicating but if you don't use the email that you have linked than we have a problem), or sometimes guests loose their smartphone or leave their phone behind. By communicating on AirBnB, you can always call AirBnB and AirBnB can read you what I have written you. If I need to get a message to you through AirBnB (I am out of wifi service which happens but is rare), I can call AirBnB and they can email you. So long story short, if you reach out to me by email, I will respond to you (if it does not go to my spam) but I will ask you to use the site. If you are not hearing from me it is 100% because your email has gone to my spam and it is not personal.

,"This is a one bedroom, one bath apartment with living and dining room. The bedroom has a queen bed and the living room couch has been slept on many times. My favorite part about the apartment is how bright it is! There are north and south facing windows and a skylight over the dining room table. There is wifi, but no TV. Also, the apartment is on the top floor of the building, so you have to walk up 2 flights of stairs. What am I going to eat?There is a Harris Teeter grocery store only 2 blocks away and Eastern Market is 7 blocks away (or one metro stop). Eastern Market is a destination for both tourists and locals because it's DC's oldest public market where you can find an indoor market and on weekends a variety of farmer stands, art, jewelry, furniture and more! It's open everyday but Monday. There are many restaurants all over Capital Hill. Near the apartment, you can take your pick of Mexican at La Lomita, bar food at Trusty's or New York Pizza for carryout. Only 7 blocks away, you'll find 8th Street lined with restaurants. It's called Barrack's Row. There are also great restaurants and coffee on 7th Street as you walk towards Eastern Market. The best places to get a drink nearby are Trusty's or Wisdom - both on Pennsylvania Ave. How am I going to get around?The metro is less than 1 block away, you don't even cross a street!. It's the Potomac Ave Station on the orange and blue line. It's less than 2 miles (3k) to walk to the US Capitol along Pennsylvania Ave and from there you can walk on the National mall to visit the museums, memorials and monuments. Both DCA and BWI airports are easy to manage on public transportation. The blue line takes you straight to DCA and you can take the orange line and transfer to the Marc Penn Line to get to BWI. If you have a car, you'll need to tell me ahead of time and I can get you a parking pass for the street.

,"THIS RENTAL SPACE IS FOR FEMALES ONLY. RED LINE METRO TO DOWNTOWN(8-10 min walk)BUS TO DOWNTOWN @ DOORPRIVATE OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE My apt is very peaceful with limited electronics. No TV. Yes WIFI. You will sleep on a queen size sofabed in the salon with a locking door for privacy at night. Especially during the Summer months, I keep all of the doors inside the apt open for airflow (PLEASE SEE HOUSE RULES), as I've got a charming old DC apt which has a window at each far end with the AC units and it takes both of them to cool down the place. As I said, at night feel free to close and lock the door if it suits you (I do!)!On my block there are restaurants (Chinese, Ethiopian, Caribean), and a Pizzeria. There is also a 24 hour corner store and a dry cleaner. The laundrymat is a short three blocks up. Any tourist can do the museums but the interesting traveler will also want to spend their time soaking up the personality of the city by visiting it's neighborhoods - welcome to the REAL DC! I'm in Takoma/Shepherd Park, and within 5 and 25 minutes to four of DC's other five/six hippest, most visited neighborhoods, which I'll name here (and do encourage you to look them up for more info). These are areas you will not want to miss while visiting DC and since they actually all run naturally into each other, once you get off in Adams Morgan, doing the rest on foot will be much more interesting than any form of transportation (except maybe renting a Capital Share city bike!!):Adams Morgan (15min), U Street (Home of Ben's Chili Bowl), 14th Street between U and M streets, and Dupont Circle.Other than these, you will probably also want to see Chinatown (bus comes at my door), Georgetown/Waterfront (Metro), Eastern Market/Capital Hill (Metro), and maybe the SouthWest Waterfront as well (bus at my door). From my place to the center of town where most museums are, is around 15 min by red line Metro train (verify at metro website time from Takoma Station to Chinatown) and 30 or so minutes by express bus. I'm adding in this bit after the fact but it was brought to my attention by a guest; Charlie's, a restaurant across the street sometimes has private parties on weekends and music can be heard inside my place when people go in and out of their door. A mere FIVE minutes away by bus (Although I prefer the approx 15 min walk), is my favorite plaza with not a tourist in sight. We have a flat mosaic fountain where people sit to take their coffee and talk with friends as children splash around in their bathing suits. There are several stores for shopping, restaurants, including; Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, Burmese, Sushi, Lebanese, Iranian, Mexican, and American - many with terraces for dining al fresco. There are cafes, artistic and mainstream movie houses, a concert venue, a live theater outfit, a wine bar and, in at least three seasons we have public concerts and events on the plaza almost daily. Saturday morning we have a charming flea market as well as a farmers market with fresh, local fruits and vegetables from local farms. There is a Whole Foods market at the plaza and the red line metro stop Silver Spring is there as well.Welcome to my city and my home - you're going to love it!p.s.

,"HELP A CAT IN NEED!I am looking for other cat lovers to rent my apartment. I foster cats for the Humane Society and rent my apartment out when I travel, or when I stay with my significant other on the weekends. It's possible that when you arrive in DC, there will be a cat or two staying with you (never more than two), depending on the needs of the Humane Society and where the cats are in the adoption process. There's also a chance I won't have any cats during your stay. If there are going to be cats with you, I will leave instructions for you in terms of their care (usually just food/water/litter) and I will make sure to send you details and pictures of the cats before you arrive. I've fostered many cats over the past year, and all of them have been super sweet and have gone on to find their forever homes. (Photo above is of one of my favorite foster cats, Glenda, who is also referred to in some of my reviews)ABOUT THE APARTMENT/NEIGHBORHOODThis place is not a rental apartment, it's my home, so I am looking for renters who will treat it as they would treat their own house. Also, it's important to note that I do live here, which means that I keep clothes, etc in the apartment. Everything is put away and I leave a whole closet open for guests, as well as a luggage rack in the bedroom, so there is plenty of space for your stuff when you arrive. My 1 bedroom/1.5 bath apartment is in the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood of Washington, DC. The bedroom has a queen bed, there is a pull out couch with a double bed in the living room. The balcony is spacious with plenty of room to unwind and even enjoy coffee or dinner al fresco. There is a jacuzzi tub in the main bath for relaxing. I provide clean linens and towels, of course!The kitchen comes stocked with the following appliances, in addition to basics like olive oil, salt, pepper, etc: •Blender •Food processor •Kitchenaid Mixer •Crock pot •Small coffee machine •Gas stove •Dishwasher•ToasterThe apartment is one block from the metro (Waterfront - Green Line) and a mile walk to the National Mall (where the Smithsonian museums are), it's the perfect place to really get a feel for the city. The Waterfront neighborhood is a quiet, residential area. There are a few restaurants within walking distance, including a fun burger joint or a waterfront watering hole. Prefer something more upscale? Station 4 is a good for a nice evening out. The neighborhood has a great, new Safeway grocery store a block away (with a Starbucks!), plus the newly refurbished Arena Stage theater three blocks away. For those of you interested in catching a baseball game, the condo is less than a mile walk to Nationals Stadium and the Navy Yard. It's a quick trip on the metro to Capitol Hill, Chinatown, or a myriad of other cool, DC neighborhoods. Zip Car, Car2Go and Capital Bikeshare are all within a few blocks walk. I can provide you with a visitor parking pass if you'd like to bring your car and park on the street, it's usually pretty easy to find a spot. But, given the proximity to the metro, a car isn't needed. I'll also provide you with two Smart Trip cards so you don't have to pay extra ($1 each trip!) for paper metro tickets. I recently renovated most of the condo in 2010, so it has a modern feel. It's located in a very secure doorman building, with internet and cable included. Shared washer/dryer in the basement -- I'll leave you a laundry card if you need it. I have a downstairs neighbor, so this isn't a party pad. But, it's a great place to explore DC. The pool is open from Memorial Day to Labor Day, and is a real oasis in the middle of the city. It's a quiet spot for relaxing after a long day of site seeing.

,"Wonderful, modern English basement in a perfect location in the Historic District of Capitol Hill. Filled with natural light and and some of our favorite household essentials, this cozy studio offers an ideal place to call home while you're in DC for work or for play. THE STUDIOThe studio is a garden apartment beneath, and separate from, our 1900s row home. Located half-way between Eastern Market and Union Station, sightseeing, restaurant, and transportation options abound.After a busy day touring or working in the nation's capitol, come home to a heated TempurPedic queen mattress, or curl up in a Crate&Barrel ""Chair-and-a-Half"" in front of a 32"" Samsung TV with DirecTV (including premium channels and Sunday Ticket), AppleTV, DVD player, Nintendo Wii, Netlix streaming and HuluPlus. Located within walking distance of some of the most exciting new restaurants on the East coast, you may not want to cook a single meal at home. But if you do, the studio's galley kitchen boasts a glass four-burner stovetop, toaster oven, microwave, sink, and top/bottom freezer and refrigerator. We have stocked the bathroom with plush linens and some of our favorite toiletries from Malin + Goetz, Neutrogena, and Kiehl's. A walk-in closet provides ample space for overpackers, but if you're traveling light, the washing machine may be a welcome sight. We appreciate good design, and we've attempted to create a modern feel with simple, clean, Scandinavian-inspired decor. Area rugs accent sealed cement and tile floors throughout. South-facing bay windows and a glass front door flood the studio with natural light, and recessed canister lighting provides a cozy ambiance at night. When the weather permits, a table and chairs for two allow guests to enjoy the smell of roses and the shade of a Crape Myrtle in our row home's traditional front garden directly in front of the studio, where the Wifi signal is still strong.By big-city standards, the studio has a secluded feel on a quiet two-lane street, and we've never received a complaint about noise. But if you aren't accustomed to city living, you should know that our street does see vehicle and foot traffic, particularly at rush hour. Honking and sirens are unusual--this isn't Manhattan--but don't be surprised to see cars and pedestrians commuting to and from the Capitol and other government buildings in our neighborhood. Given the prime location and pleasant sidewalks, walkers and joggers are also common. We've spent many nights in the studio ourselves, and we've never heard our neighbors to the West (a pedestrian alley sits to the East). That said, the house, which was built over a century ago, can be creaky, and you can hear footsteps above from time to time. Again, we've never received a complaint about noise, but we want you to be aware of what row home living in the Historic District is like.THE LOCATIONSituated between the Eastern Market/Barrack's Row area and the exciting H Street corridor, the studio is walking distance from two neighborhoods exploding with new restaurants and bars, and we are happy to tell you where you NEED to be eating. We're six blocks from the Supreme Court, the Capitol, and the Library of Congress. The Mall is a beautiful twenty-minute walk, providing easy access to the Smithsonian's museums. We're a 12-minute walk (a little longer with luggage) or a five-minute taxi from Union Station (Amtrak and Red Line), and even closer to the Eastern Market Metro station (Blue and Orange Lines). We also have four Capital Bikeshare stations within a five-block radius, providing a great way to see DC.THE AMENITIES- Flexible check-in with digital entry code- TV with DirecTV (including premium channels and Sunday Ticket), AppleTV, DVD player, Nintendo Wii, Netlix streaming and HuluPlus - High-speed Internet (WiFi only)- Basic kitchen amenities- Bodum French press (Counter Culture coffee provided)- Washer/dryer- Iron and ironing board- Half a block from dry cleaner- Brand new, top-of-the-line ductless A/C and heat- Walk to the best DC has to offer- Approximately half a mile from Eastern Market Metro (Blue/Orange Lines) and Union Station (Amtrak, Red Line)- Six blocks from Eastern Market's restaurants and weekend open-air market- Six blocks from H Street, DC's trending culinary and nightlife district- Unbeatable neighborhood for jogging and dog-walking- Surrounded by Capital Bikeshare stations- If you're nice, cookies.",50.5,101,1,-76.99762224284615,101.0,898,Real Bed,2,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/952779,38.8918086818647,Entire home/flat

First floor is foyer, living and dining rooms, and stairwell; second floor - bed rooms and guest bath. The attic makes up the third floor. Please click on 'Street View' above our photos, as well as our photos, to get a feel for the house layout and for our neighborhood. We'd like to provide the answers to the most frequently asked questions we receive from potential guests. If after reading the following information and looking through our photos, checking out our Street View (tab above photos) and looking over our Amenities list (tab above this description), you still have questions or concerns, please message or call us and we'll be happy to clarify or answer a question not touched on here.1) Is the bath shared? No. As our homepage notes, the guest bath is private. Guests do *not* share the bath with others (except your travel companion, if you've got one). This means additional privacy and comfort for you. While not en suite, the guest bath is located directly across from guest room. Please see our photos for details. Both the guest room and guest bath are on the second floor at the top of the stairwell. Please see photos.2) What kind of bed is in the guest room? Traditional 'Real' bed with extra deep mattress. It's an American queen-size traditional pillow-topped mattress by Simmons. Model is Balthazar. It is firm yet extremely comfortable. We receive constant positive feedback from our guests on how comfortable the bed is and that they experience a sound restful sleep. 3) How many people are in the home? Two. Your hosts. We have our own bath in the master bed room.4) Is your home an apartment/condo? Is it a whole house rental? As our homepage states, it's a house with private guest room. This is a SHARED house arrangement. Please note at the top left our homepage listing property description: House---Private Room. Also, please review the long rectangular box in the middle of our homepage where it reads and answers: Room Type, Bed Type, Accommodates, Bed Rooms, Bath Rooms, Extra People, Minimum Stay, Weekly Price etc....This means you are renting a private guest room and private guest bath, with community (shared) areas. Our 1937 single family (detached) multi-level colonial-style house floor plan is extremely typical for Washington, DC-Alexandria, VA-Baltimore, MD, Philadelphia/NJ/NYC and is in no way unique to the region. Shared spaces (dining room, living room, front porch) are on the first floor. Bed and bath rooms on the second floor. Front and back yards are flat and on street level. HOWEVER, there are 4 steps from street level to our porch. We use our third floor attic for storage only at this time - it is NOT a shared living space. Please see our photos for visuals. Several pixs illustrate the multi-level architecture of our home. (Please see photos.) Please click on Street View tab (Above photos) for exterior shots showing architectural style in our area.Our first floor living and dining rooms are shared spaces, refrigerator and microwave and laundry room are all shared as well. Covered front porch, backyard and bbq are free for our guests to use at their leisure too. (Please see our photos.)5) Are you downtown? No. As mentioned, we are located in the upper north-west quadrant of Washington, DC 2 miles east of Chevy Chase, DC; 2 miles south of downtown Silver Spring, Maryland and 4 miles north of Dupont Circle.....which means we are ""uptown."" Please click on the Maps tab located just below our title and right above our photos. Use the + key to zoom in to our neighborhood. Or do an online search for Takoma, Washington, DC.6) Do you have air-conditioning? Yes. As our amenity list notes, we have a modern centralized ac/heat system. Our ac/heat system is just 3 years old, very efficient and quiet. We gladly use it when it is hot and humid. However, if our guests prefer for us to leave it off, we're ok with that too. (There is also a ceiling fan in the guest room which you control yourself.)7) What are ""guest service fees""? Your hosts have no control over AirBnB guest service fees. We, as hosts, are also charged a service fee for every reservation booked through Airbnb. The following info was taken from AirBnB's Help Center:AirBnB charges guests a 6-12% service fee every time a reservation is booked for the use of our online platform. This service fee is added to guest payments. It covers the cost of running the site and allows us to offer amazing 24/7 customer service. We also charge hosts a host service fee to cover the cost of processing payments.The exact percentage for the guest service fee depends on the subtotal of the reservation. The higher the total, the lower the percentage so guests can save money when booking large reservations.Both guest and host service fees are calculated from the reservation subtotal. The subtotal is the complete price of a reservation before service fees have been added and is calculated from the listing's pricing settings. If you have more questions about AirBnB service fees please contact AirBnB directly.8) Do you offer breakfast? Yes. We offer a variety of breakfasts for an additional fee. As our amenities list shows, it is *not* included in the daily rate. Please see photos for shot of our Continental Breakfast table. Breakfast is available from 7:30-9:30 am (a little later on Sat/Sun & holidays). Continental is a light breakfast, as opposed to an American/English-style or cooked (eg, eggs-bacon-hash browns-pancakes). If you prefer a cooked breakfast this can usually be arranged as well. For breakfast details, please inquire, or read details in our house manual.If you do not care for breakfast, included in the daily rate is French Roast coffee, selection of teas, hot cocoa, organic oj, Deer Park Spring Water, fresh fruit and variety of granola bars, KIND bars, Clif bars and breakfast bars.We also offer dinner. For more info please inquire or after booking you will receive our House Manual which details available breakfasts and dinner options.9) Do you have WiFi? Yes. Just as our amenities list indicates, WiFi/Internet is included in the daily rate. Ours is enhanced high-speed FIOS-WiFi from Verizon. All utilities are included in the room rate. Click on ""Amenities"" to see what is included. 10) Are you near a metro (train) station? Yes. We're a very easy (terrain is flat) 15 minute walk or a 5 minute bike from Takoma Metro Station (red line). HOWEVER, if you do not wish to walk/bike to or from the station, there are buses which run every 15 minutes during rush hour (AM & PM) and every 20 minutes during non-rush hours from the station to our corner 5 houses away. There are also taxis. We are also within 2 and 4 blocks of other bus routes like Express and Crosstown lines. Bus routes to mid/downtown Washington (we're uptown) and downtown Silver Spring run every 10 minutes or less daily, including weekends. To National Institutes of Health or Bethesda Row (shopping & dining area) from Silver Spring by bus is just 25 minutes (faster than train). Download the app for Washington Metro train and bus real time arrivals/departures so you can plan your trips accordingly. 11) Do you charge for bike rental? No. We share our older but very well maintained hybrid bikes, bike lock and helmets with our guests. Bikes are included in the daily/weekly/monthly rate. Bikes are equipped with reflectors and lights on both front and rear for added safety. If you would care to use our bikes during your stay, please let us know when you make your reservation so we can have the bike(s) ready for your arrival. 12) Do you have pets? Yes. Just as our pictures show and homepage indicates, we have 2 friendly cats who do NOT enter the guest room unless you invite them. One cat is quite shy and the other is very social. Please see our photos for pet pixs. We also have a double yellow-headed Amazon parrot. He's a charming parrot with a sweet disposition. He's very friendly and loves to dance. He's usually in Larry's office, or when weather is nice, he's outside. (Please see our photos for pet pixs.)13) My family of 4 would like to stay at Guest Nest; is this possible? No. Sorry we canNOT accommodate more than 2 guests at one time. As our homepage indicates, we have ONE guest room which is appropriate for up to 2 guests. No exceptions. Please see photos for details. 14) My friend and I are travelling together; may we have 2 separate rooms/beds? No. As our homepage states and photos show, we do NOT rent multiple rooms. We offer 1 guest room for up to 2 people. The guest room is furnished with ONE American queen-size bed. Please see our photos for details. 15) Is there a curfew? No. We do NOT have a curfew. Come and go as you please. 16) Is it easy to park near your home? Yes - very! Parking is free, non-competitive and plentiful! You can always park on our block at any time of the day or night. If not directly in front of our home, just a few doors away. Our block offers stress-free parking. 0 daily time limits. 0 street cleaning ""No Parking"" hours. 0 rush hour ""No Parking"" times. 0 meters. Our free and friendly parking rules translate to 0 hassle, 0 dollars and 0 tickets for you. 17) Do you have a swimming pool? Sadly no. Unfortunately, unlike in California, not many homeowners in the Washington area install swimming pools. We are however, less than 1 mile from the Takoma Aquatic Center. And about 3 miles from Wilson Aquatic Center. These are the nicest and newest community pools in Washington. We do supply sunscreen and over-sized beach towels.18) Is there a refrigerator in the guest room? No. But we happily share our kitchen fridge with our guests.19) Does the guest room have a closet? Yes with new velvet covered non-slip hangers, picnic basket, yoga mats, umbrellas, slippers, bath robes, extra bath towels and over-sized beach towels. These items are for our guests to use while we're are hosting them.20) Should I bring my own towels or bed linens? No. Not unless you would like to. We provide both bath and bed linens. All are 100% cotton, and some are organic cotton/bamboo. Extra bath towels are on top shelf in guest room closet. 21) Do you have a hair dryer? Yes. There is a new hair dryer in the guest bath room.22) Do I have to bring my own soap-shampoo-conditioner? No. Not unless you want to. We always have EO liquid soap and shampoo & conditioner can be Garnier-Aveda-Loreal or other similar quality name brand. We usually have two brands of shampoo & conditioner for our guests. We also provide face cleansers (usually Burt's Bees, Aveeno or Garnier), Tom's Toothpaste, sunscreen and a variety of other skin and hair care products. If you need a particular skin-hair-health care item there is a CVS and Safeway within walking distance of our home. Target, Bloomingdale's, MAC, Neiman Marcus, Whole Foods and Lord & Taylor within 15 minutes by public transportation. 2 Blue Mercury locations within 30 minutes by public transit.23) Can we use the kitchen for cooking? No. Just as our amenity list shows (basic Amenities List tab is above our photos), we do NOT share our kitchen. In Washington, DC (and many other locations) hosts who rent guest rooms in their homes cannot legally allow guests to use their oven or stove top without special additional insurance (which we do not have at this time). Also, our 1937 galley kitchen has not yet been renovated. However, we do share our electric kettle, coffee maker, press pot, microwave and bbq. Guests may also use our kitchen for non-cooked meals like sandwiches and salads. We also have free bbq supplies for guests who would like to grill.24) Is there a washer & dryer? Yes. We share our washer & dryer and laundry detergent free-of-charge to guests for small loads of clothing and normal size linens. Anything heavier/larger like a blanket or thick winter coat will have to go to the laundromat or dry cleaners. Or if you don't have the time to do laundry, or our housekeeper Estella will wash-iron-fold for $8/per load.25) Do you, the host, provide for guest train/bus expenses? No. Travel expenses are the sole responsibility of the guest. However we DO provide SmarTrip cards for use on both Washington Metro trains and buses. SmarTrip cards give discounts on train/bus travel and free bus transfers. It is the guest's responsibility to ""load"" the SmarTrip card with money so that it can be used for train/bus travel.26) May I pay cash for the room when I arrive? No. All transactions for room rental are through Airbnb. This is for your safety and security as well as ours. Thank you.27) Can you give me a discount? Yes. If you're in the armed forces or employed in education. If you are, we offer a 10% discount on the room rate. Please direct us to online source which gives your bio, or when you check-in show military or education employment identification and we'll adjust your total. We offer a 10% discount to our past guests who reviewed us as well.A Few Details:•We get asked about crime in Washington a lot. Where we live, in upper north-west Washington, the neighborhoods are among the safest in Washington. 16th Street Heights-Chevy Chase-Brightwood(north)-Takoma-Shepherd Park-Colonial Village are extremely safe areas. Our neighborhood is safe for walking/biking late night, as well as, safe for your car. Please do not take our word for it, check out current DC crime statistics, we encourage visitors to search online for crime maps, like Spot Crime. Another excellent online resource is Area Vibes, search ""Takoma Park, Washington, DC"". You may also want to check out info on Wiki ""Takoma, Washington, DC"" and ""Takoma Park, MD"". Since we're so close to the Maryland line and both neighborhoods share the Old Town business district area, a lot of online sites interchange Takoma, DC with Takoma Park, DC - even when technically part of the neigborhood is in Maryland.If you need more info about online crime maps, or where we're located on the map, please inquire.•Your guest room is 100% private and clean. Guest room with a real bed (3 yr old extremely comfortable Simmons luxurious deep pillow-top mattress, firm yet soft). Both the mattress and pillows are protected with allergen/pest covers. We take cleanliness seriously. It is a basic element of true hospitality. However, it should be common sense that if you cancel housekeeping (although we will tidy up throughout the week) our home will be less so. •New bed linens. 100% cotton (some organic). What touches your skin is important. Our bed linens are less than 2 years old. They are laundered in Purex no perfume/dye detergent.•Our cleaning supply stock is almost exclusively Mrs. Meyer's organic, earth-friendly and safe. We also steam clean the mattress monthly and steam clean our floors weekly. The guest bath is steamed cleaned between guests.•Your guest bath is clean and private. It's across the hall from the guest room, opposite the second floor stair landing. (Please see photos for visuals.) No awkward bath share. No hot water issues. Your bath is 100% private during your stay.•New 100% cotton bath linens. We launder all our bed and bath linens in Purex Free, no perfume/no dyes.•Guest bath is fully stocked with organic plant-based EO Everyone Soap, quality shampoos and conditioners, hair grooming products, Tom's of Maine all natural toothpaste, skincare products, disposable razors, shaving cream, variety of SPF lotions etc....We offer our guests quality skin and hair care products.•We have modern central air-conditioning and heating system. No obtrusive and noisy floor/window ac units. •We have 2 Holmes air purifiers running all summer long. Our pets do not go into the guest room or bath. However, if you are allergic to cats, its probably best for you to stay with a non-cat host.•Travel globally - stay locally. Not a prefab cookie-cutter ""neighborhood"" nor cold downtown area. Now a historic district which was developed in 1888 as a Victorian spa and resort village for swanky Washingtonians. Takoma has the first public library to open in Washington. This 1911 Renaissance Revival building is a Carnegie library which was beautifully restored in 2008.•Takoma/Takoma Park is a tranquil quiet neighborhood. Technically in-the-city but surrounded by the lush landscape of both Rock Creek Park and Sligo Creek Trail creates a natural urban oasis. There's a strong sense of community. People say hello as you pass along the sidewalk. You won't find abandoned buildings, neglected homes or trash in the street. We don't have neighbors yelling at all hours (at any hours). Residents aren't partying late night and into early morning. You won't see people loitering or drug dealing. It is rare to hear police car sirens, or those of an ambulance or fire truck. It's unusual to even see police cars, an ambulance or fire truck. You will NOT hear gun shots. If you are sensitive to city noise, or concerned about safety - we offer the perfect solution for peace-of-mind and accessibility to major universities and research centers, as well as popular tourist sites like monuments and museums.•Takoma/Takoma Park is frequently referred to as ""The Berkeley of the East"" and voted one of the top places to live in the Washington region. The area is rich with journalists, photographers, painters, ceramicists, dancers, educators, authors, musicians, singers, bloggers, scientists, designers, yoga teachers, skate boarders, bicyclists, organic gardeners, chefs, massage therapists, healing arts practitioners and we're also home of the unique Takoma Wellness Center - the only rabbi owned and operated medical marijuana dispensary in the world. The residents here move to the beat of a different drummer. If you desire suits & ties, policy wonks and wonkettes - you'll probably not find them here.•Our home is non-smoking but we DO allow cigarette smoking outside and we supply ashtrays without any judgement. :)RESERVATIONS:BEFORE booking, please create a COMPLETE AirBnB guest profile.

,"This is a private, clean bedroom with a small, private back patio and direct access to a two-sink full bathroom with a toilet separated with a door. The apartment is old but very charming and two levels, with a free washer/dryer in apartment. You would also have shared-access to the living room (w/ fireplace), a full kitchen with a huge refrigerator, and although the bottom bathroom is shared, you could have the half-bathroom upstairs all to yourself if you'd like. You really cannot beat this neighborhood - it is on U Street, a 7-minute walk to DuPont Circle, and right at the bottom of Adam's Morgan. Countless bars, restaurants, and a doggie park are right outside, but the apartment itself is in a private courtyard enclave, which makes it very quiet. We have a parking pass for you! You may not understand how great that is....but it is GREAT!The apartment is a ten-minute walk to the DuPont Circle metro (red line), and a seven-minute walk to the U Street metro (yellow / green lines). There are also several bus lines near by - but mostly, we walk everywhere because a lot of the bars / restaurants / places people would meet up are within walking distance for us. Your ""roommates"" would be myself and my boyfriend - we are super nice, laid-back, liberal, in our 20s, and not really in the house all that often! I travel to NYC a lot for work so sometimes it is just him. Also, we have two nice cats.

,"Hello! This is a lovely bright studio in the heart of Dupont Circle. This is a great apartment on a quiet street in the middle of the city. You can walk to the White House and lots of fun restaurants from the apartment. This listing is for a lovely stay on the orange futon pictured. I'll make turn it into a bed for you with sheets and towels and all that jazz! We will share this lovely small studio apartment! Yay.THE APARTMENT: A quiet studio on the fourth floor of a five story apartment building in Dupont Circle. The building has an elevator. The main room is 350 sq. feet but there is an additional walk-in closet, kitchen area, and bathroom. The room has a lovely view of some big trees next door.Futon: Your bed will be the orange futon pictured. I will provide fresh sheets and towels. The orange futon is from Target. Target is like Ikea for those who are unfamiliar with Target. This is not a top quality futon. If you need a super comfortable bed to sleep, this may not be for you. If your main priority is to be in a fun apartment in the safest part of town surrounded by lots of yummy restaurants, then this is the perfect apartment for you. Bathroom: The bathroom has a full tub. And of course you could just use it for a shower. A hairdryer is also provided.There is a TV (without cable) in the room and a DVD player for your fun. There is also free WIFI. I also have an HDMI cable that you can hook into your computer to watch movies or whatever you'd like from your computer on the big TV. In addition there is obviously an air conditioner unit/fan and lots of heat.The refrigerator is small, for America, but it has certainly treated me well. Feel free to stock any small kitchen supplies. The stove/oven in the apartment was unplugged and so it does not function. There is a hotplate with two burners, a microwave, an electric can opener, a crock pot and a toaster that you should feel free to use. Most important - there is an espresso machine!I also have a yoga mat that you should use as you please. I have subscriptions to a lot of magazines such as Vogue, W, Glamour, Lucky, Vanity Fair, Fortune, Bloomberg Business Week, Budget Travel, People Style Watch, Travel & Leisure, etc. I have all the last four issues or so under my coffee table. Feel free to peruse through all the magazines.There are washing machines and dryers in the basement of my building. You can feel free to go down there and wash all your clothes. You have to buy a card for five dollars before you can wash anything. It is two dollars for a wash and 2.00 to dry.I have a book of helpful information for your stay. It includes maps, information on local restaurants, helpful tips on the apartment, etc.Breakfast: There is no breakfast in the apartment. There is a great little cafe downstairs though and another one two blocks away. There is also a grocery store around the corner. Yum yum.THE LOCATION: Dupont Circle Area. The apartment is a five to ten minute walk from the Dupont Circle Metro Stop on the Red Line. You could also walk from the Green/Yellow Line's U-Street/African-American Civil War Memorial Stop but it would take about 20-25 minutes. The apartment building is located one building off of trendy 17th Street which is filled with restaurants, bars, nail salons, yogurt places, etc. A large grocery store is around the corner. Also there are two liquor stores and a 7-11 within feet of the apartment. From the apartment you could walk to the White House (about 20 minutes) or to the U-Street area (about 8 minutes) or Dupont Circle (about 5 minutes) or over to 14th Street (about 10 minutes). I repeat, within one block there is a 7-11 Convenience store, a supermarket, two liquor stores, a dry cleaner, numerous food options, a bar, etc. All sorts of fun!ACCESS: You can take the Metro's Red Line to Dupont Circle. From there it is a 5-10 minute walk. There are also numerous bus options available. Washington DC is a very walkable city and you can walk to the White House and other attractions easily from here. Perhaps more importantly, the area is overflowing with great restaurants!ROOMMATES: I will be your roommate. I'm a 29 year old woman who has traveled extensively and I'd love to share my little home to others who are traveling through DC. This apartment is in the heart of the city (and the part of the city with the highest rent) so the space is small! I love sharing my home and I hope the great location will be great for you as well. But again, this is a small studio and we will both be there - just an FYI! SLEEP: Since we are sharing the apartment, sleep is pretty important. Sleeptime is between midnight and 7am. If you want to catch a bus to Philadelphia at 4am, please do not stay here! I promise to never book the place if I have to get up super early either. It is only fair for the both of us! I have no dogs, cats, or pets of any kind. There is no smoking in the building.GUIDEBOOKS: I have a welcome packet with all sorts of information and I have the most recent version of the Lonely Planet DC guidebook that you are more than welcome to use during your stay. So don't buy a guidebook if you stay here!Note: This is not a luxury apartment and the orange futon would probably not make it into the Ritz. If you are super tall or need a super comfortable bed to get to sleep, this may not be for you. That said, a tall friend (6 feet, 1.82 m) is sleeping there right now and has not had a complaint! He just made a song about how his feet hang off the end of the futon. Parking: DC is not a car friendly city. The apartment is a 5-10 minute walk to the Dupont Circle Metro stop. The apartment is also on many major bus routes. If you really want to bring your car, you can park it on the street on weekends and holidays but PLEASE pay attention to the street signs. Parking tickets in DC usually run around $100. If I had a car here, I would not risk worrying about street parking and I would park in one of the nearby garages. There is a parking garage at 17th and P Street where you can park your car for $16 a day. The garage is a five minute walk from my apartment.EXTRAS: Hair Dryer, Wifi, TV, DVD Player, Toaster, Crock Pot, Yoga Mat, Espresso Machine, Microwave, Clean Towels, Lonely Planet DC GuidebookOne Person: A few people have asked me if two people can stay at the apartment. I'd love to have everyone stay at my place but unfortunately the futon really can only fit one person. So really, this listing is only for one awesome person for the futon.Air Conditioning: As you can see in the photos, there is an air conditioning unit in the window that is above the futon. The air conditioning unit makes a humming noise when it is on, like all in window air conditioning units. DC is extremely hot during the summer and into the fall. The temperature often reaches 90 degrees (33 C). Whatever you do, do not turn off the air conditioning unit at night. If you need absolute quiet to sleep, do not stay here. The air conditioner needs to work and hum along so that both of us staying in the apartment do not have to sleep in very hot conditions!Check In/Check Out: Please try to check in around 2pm. Please try to check out around noon. If you need to stay later or arrive earlier, just let me know. It should work out. The Airbnb calendar is accurate through October 2013. Unfortunately I do not know my schedule beyond August so if you message me about those dates, I will not be able to book them right now. If you need to stay an extra day or two that are not available on the calendar, just let me know. It should work out.

,"Overview: This two-and-half bedroom house is in a cute residential neighborhood on Capitol Hill, 4.5 blocks from the metro, and 1.5 blocks from a major grocery store and Starbucks. This house has central air, Wi-Fi, gas for cooking, and plenty of street parking.. A lot of DC is devoid of grocery stores FYI so this spot is ideal. The house also has a private office space/den great for professionals or for a sleeping baby. The house is petite by American standards but common by European standards. Neighborhood: Five blocks away the Capitol Hill Dome is in full view. Historic Eastern Market, the second oldest open air market built in 1805, is seven blocks away and perfect for picking up fresh veggies at the farmer's market, gifts, and getting Maryland crab sandwiches. Barrack's Row, also a historic area and home to the General of the Marine Corps, is seven blocks away. This ""Row”, scattered along Marine Corps headquarters, has dozens of shops like Sweet Lobby, a cupcake shop featured on the Food Network and boutique restaurants (E.g. Belga: Belgian, Cava: Greek, and Ted's Bulletin, a 1940's diner with adult milkshakes and homemade pop tarts. It's very charming area as franchises are not zoned for Barracks Row and there is a theater, bread bakery, frozen yogurt shop, etc. The house: This brick row home home has new hard wood floors, stainless steel appliances and was renovated in 2007. There is a little patio out in the back and a front porch. If you want to feel what real Capitol Hill neighborhood is like--this is it.

I can set up a crib at no cost but I need advanced notice on the crib.

You can see it from the master bedroom as well.The apartment is in a townhouse that was converted into condos at the end of last year. It's all brand new, and everything works well. The unit is spread across three floors. There is bedroom on the first floor of the apartment (which is the first floor of the building; fear not – there are no ground-floor windows or anything like that). This bedroom has a set of bunk beds and its own bathroom.The second floor of the apartment is an open-plan living room and kitchen that is both light and airy and cozy at the same time. It’s a neat trick, and the apartment pulls if off nicely. The third floor is entirely taken up by the master bedroom. It is also where you can access the roof deck, which will be yours and only yours for the length of your stay. No one else has access – in fact, none of the neighbors can even see onto it.The neighborhood is great. Turn left coming out of the building, and you’ll be heading to Adam’s Morgan.

But Amanda's mother can provide a laundry service at $10/load upon request. - The hot water takes 3 minutes to come out of the shower. Just turn on the shower 3 minutes before you expect to jump in. Old plumbing means it takes a while for the water to heat up. However, there is ample supply of warm water once it arrives.All that being said, we live in a great, safe neighborhood, and will be happy to help you enjoy your stay in DC.",14.5,58,1,-77.07864325060552,58.0,1015,Real Bed,4,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/703116,38.923614461476696,Entire home/flat

,"Hello all :) this hip H Street location is for women only (sorry guys). This 1900s rowhouse with its charming original hardwood floors and antique chandeliers is only a short walk to Union Station, Union Market shops, H St Atlas District, U.S. Capitol, Eastern Market (open market sat-sun), Barracks Row/8th Street, Library of Congress, & Folger Theater. Perfect for a weekend getaway, business trip, or to rent while you are looking for something more permanent.This is a 3 bedroom, 2 bath two story rowhouse in the historic H Street Corridor. This private room rental price includes full run of the house (i.e. use of the massive kitchen, backyard patio, laundry room, dining room, cable on the 55"" 3D flatscreen etc). It is a short walk to Union Station (Metro, Amtrak, Regional Buses or DC Circulator) or 1 block from city bus across town/downtown (X2). Help yourself to provided coffee, tea in the AM. (I know if I was a traveler this is the one thing I would need before my eyes fully open). Every effort is made to provide a plush, warm, respectful environment where you can feel at home, rest & unwind, yet maintain privacy. The room is very light and inviting with Athenian green walls and white linen bedding. There is a spacious walk-in closet where you can hang up clothes and with plenty of room to keep your luggage out of site during your stay. ABOUT THE H STREET NEIGHBORHOOD/LOCATION -1 block from H Street (also known as the Atlas District), DC's fastest up and coming neighborhood for great food and nightlife such as local hot spots: Rock & Roll Hotel (live music), H Street Country Club (skeeball and indoor minigolf in this local dive bar), and Boundry Road (one of Obama's favorite restaurants). Check out The Washingtonian online. Many of H St's bars/restaurants are listed as some of the best in DC. -Capitol Hill is a village in a city: it's friendly, safe, great for families and professionals -Walking distance to tons of great restaurants -Easy access by bus, metro or bike to the National Mall and downtown-If you are a runner: excellent roughly 3 mile epic roundtrip run to the Capitol TRANSPORTATION & PARKING -WALK: Easy 10-15 minute walk from the Metro at Union Station. -BUS: The X2, a commuter bus, stops 1 block away. ~15 min bus ride to Chinatown/Metro center with subway access to the entire city.-METRO: Access to the either the red line or the green/yellow line are each a 20 minute walk through beautiful neighborhoods. -BIKE: A great way to get to the metro or around town is to rent a bike from one of the Bike Shares just 2 blocks from the house. Only 7$ a day or 15$ for three days! You can park the bike at any location around the city. -CAR: Parking is plentiful on our block because DC utilizes a permit system. I can obtain a 7 day parking permit for you if your stay is >2 nights. CHECK IN: 8pmCHECK OUT: noon You can come early on days where myself or my roommate is off work. I am off certain weekends/weekdays so this will just need to be arranged prior to arrival. My female roommate is fantastic and I have a lovely little beagle/boxer mix Darwin. She is a great little dog and basically will be your best friend if you show her any sort of affection [treats are by the front door :) ].THINGS TO NOTE -If you are allergic to dogs, this may not be a place for you, as Darwin does have free run of the house (except for the room you will be staying in, the door to the guest room is closed even when not in use). My roommate is allergic to dogs however and Darwin doesn't bother her at all.-There is a front entrance and the living room, kitchen, dining room are all on the first floor (bedrooms are all on the 2nd) which allows you flexibility to come and go as you like; as long as you are reasonably quiet, and do not disturb myself or my roommate if you come in super late. -If I am off work and you would like someone to explore DC with or need a little direction, I love meeting new people and am always game for a run, catching some live music, museum hopping, or a beer on one of H Street's lovely patios. Even if you don't choose to stay at my place, definitely check out H Street!...it is the new hip/divey part of DC and it would be a tragedy to not check out the local flare.

,"What could be better than a studio? Why, a studio in the heart of the District, of course! Living here, I never use public transportation because I walk. Everywhere! Needless to say I don't have a parking spot. I am one block away from the grocery store, fun bars, fantastic restaurants, and coffee shops (for when you need to check your email- yes, this is a block away, too!). If you're here for business, I'm a twenty minute walk from the Convention Center. Also, my buddy Barack Obama lives only a few blocks away.I'm very close to downtown, DuPont Circle, U Street, and subway stations (we call it the metro here). Not a walker? We have a bikeshare program in the district that let's anyone move about the area on two wheels. Not a biker either? There's a steady stream of taxis passing by since there's a lot of hotels around here. I've never waited longer than five minutes for a cab- even at odd hours of the night. If you need some help choosing one of the many amazing things to do, send me a message and I'll help you out. Across the street is a Holiday Inn where the cheapest room is 239 bucks (when I last checked)! My place is a steal for this location and you've got a kitchen too! Take a look at the pics. Since the pictures were taken, I painted a wall with chalkboard paint so you can let out your creative side (drawing is encouraged!). Also, I have a different couch. I've got a queen-sized bed and the couch that will fit someone comfortably that's shorter than 6 ft. If the place is available that means I'm travelling and you have it all to yourself. My place comes with no Internet or television to distract you from enjoying your vacation. If you're coming to visit this city, instead of watching a movie, you should walk two blocks away to the Studio Theatre, see a play, and you can use the money you saved by not doing a hotel. There's an elevator to get you to the seventh floor. I have great air conditioning that will help with the summer heat and heating for the winter. I get great water pressure and plenty of hot water. If you need to wash clothes, there's a washer and dryer one floor below me off the hallway.

,"Enjoy staying in the heart of the city, within walking distance to Union Station, the Capitol and some of the most hip, interesting and beautiful neighborhoods in DC! Your spacious room with newly renovated, ensuite bathroom offers you privacy and a comfortable, cozy place to relax after a long day of seeing the sights. I provide fresh towels, a super comfy queen size bed, WiFi, and your own room and bathroom! I'm also in a fantastic location for travelers - you have easy access to two metro lines (red and blue/orange), and you'll be two blocks from several bus lines and a bike share that will take you across the city! I'm very flexible with check-in (I know what it's like to walk around a city with luggage all day...) and will leave a key for you if I'm at work so you can get in. That said, I often have guests departing on the day new guests arrive, so there will often be overlap where I will not be able to clean your room until I get home. I always let people know if this is the case, but please note that I when you arrive, the room will potentially still be messy from the last guest. I do this to be as accommodating to all travelers as possible, but it doesn't always leave the best first impression!Also, I have the room listed as suitable for 3 because I originally set up this account to cater to student/budget travelers like myself. There is only 1 bed, and the floor is tiled - I have had guests bring air mattresses, or make a mattress on the floor with my couch cushions or sleeping pads - if that is something you're interested in, it's very suitable for 3! If everyone wants their own bed, it probably won't work. I am also fine with having guests sleep on the couch - it's very comfy! But it is also in the main living space of the house so not very private. I've listed some ""highlights"" below, with more detailed descriptions of certain things - but feel free to ask any questions you may have! The main reasons to stay: + You're 1.2 miles from Union Station and the Capitol/The Mall (~20 min. walk) + You'll be a block from H St. - a really fun, hip neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars, and nightlife+ You'll also be within walking distance of the Capital Hill/Eastern Market neighborhood - more restaurants, bars and things to see and do+ You can walk to 3 bus lines and 2 metro stations - getting you anywhere you need to go+ Walk 2 blocks to a Capital Bike Share station+ Walking distance to several parks and the historic Eastern Market+ Free street parking right out front (certain zoning laws do apply)+ Walk to a Safeway or an Aldi grocery store+ Very flexible check in/out - I will try my best to accommodate your crazy travel schedule!+ Washer/Dryer available+ Pet, child, LGBT friendlyAnd some more in depth info... The apartment itself is newly renovated, with two bedrooms (I'll be staying in the other) with a large ""living space"" made up of the living room and kitchen - which you are more than welcome to use. I don't have a TV - but free WiFi for all! You can watch the heck out of some Netflix when you're not busy checking out the city! I think the best reason for staying here is that I'm 1 block from H St, where you can find lots of unique restaurants, bars, wine bars, coffee shops, and a few ""full of local flavor"", thrift stores. But, you are also within walking distance (~ 1 mile) of the East end of The Mall (the Capitol, National Archives, Supreme Court Building, Library of Congress, etc.). Many of my guests say they walk instead of bus actually - but it's nice to be able to take the bus if you can! I also have a nice little back ""patio"" area. I use that term loosely since I don't really have any furniture, but you can go out and dance or smoke a cigarette, or sit in the grass and just relax. Sometimes, my dog, James Taylor, will be staying with us - he's very friendly and loves people and other dogs. He will expect you to pet him, but I can also keep him out of your way if you're not so much a dog person. However, he typically won't be around - but please check in if dogs are a concern for you. You can park on the street at night, but during the day there are time restrictions. A few final notes: This apartment is in the basement of a row house and relatively small. The guest room (your room) is the largest, so I truly ""live"" in my living room, and it is often cluttered... I am more than willing to share my kitchen with you, but please note that it may not always be as clean or straightened up as you would prefer. I'm gone a lot of the time, often I don't even meet my guests due to their travel schedules and my work schedule. So if you are looking for someone to be around a lot, that is probably not me although I always hope to at least meet my guests! I feel that it is a space well-suited to student/budget travelers (this is why I set my price significantly lower than other places in the city) and it is not a luxury apartment. Your room will always be cleaned thoroughly and you will always have access to the living room/kitchen, with the understanding that I may be doing my laundry and it may be set in stacks around the couch. Speaking of which, you can use my laundry machines as long as I'm not using them! I'm LGBT friendly, overall pretty friendly, and look forward to providing you with a clean room at a reasonable price! *Note: the red carpet in the pictures has been replaced with a striped/multi-color carpet - the red one was damaged by water when Hurricane Sandy hit. I have not updated pictures because I can't take nearly as nice pictures with my phone and everything else is the same!",15.0,45,1,-76.980286,45.0,1087,Real Bed,3,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/406932,38.898335,Private room

Also located blocks away from the Omni Shoreham and Marriott hotels. Numerous restaurants, bars, and cafes are less than 3 blocks away, or it's only a 15-minute walk to Mount Pleasant (north) and Dupont Circle (south), two more great neighborhoods for dinner and drinks with coworkers or friends. Like to run? Head out the back door of the building to several running paths through Rock Creek Park and the National Zoo.AMENITIESThis first floor corner unit has full windows that wrap around the apartment on two sides overlooking tree-lined streets. Neighbors are quiet professionals. The kitchen is fully stocked with cooking ware, dishes, wine glasses, etc. and a full-size stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, crock pot, and microwave.

My friends and family joke that she's the most dog-like cat they've ever met. She's shaved year round which means there is little to virtually no shedding at all.

There are three clean and comfortable rooms available for short or medium-term rental here -- this ad is for the medium one, which is composed of two connected rooms. The house has a front porch and back deck, an open floor plan and wood floors throughout – it’s been compared to a yoga studio or meditation center – and I like to think that those who stay here find a degree of tranquility while enjoying the city and the neighborhood.I work as the technology for development guy at an international development nonprofit, so I’m often out traveling the world and may not be in the country for your stay. I like to cook, so if you do too, this is the place for you -- you'll have full access to the gourmet kitchen with an island cooktop, double oven, warming drawer and gas grill on the deck – along with most cooking implements you are likely to need. From time-to-time when schedules align and there’s interest among whoever’s at the house, we sometimes cook, drink or hang out together, but don’t worry – you can go solo too.During your stay, be sure to treat yourself to breakfast at Qualia Coffee -- which filter brews fresh, micro roasted coffee a few blocks away. When night falls, explore the neighborhood's growing selection of bars and restaurants, including The Looking Glass, Chez Billy´s, The Mothership Connection (new at Georgia Ave. and Lamont!), DC Reynold´s, The Hitching Post, The Sweet Mango Cafe, Sala Thai, and more, or take a 10-minute walk to trendy Columbia Heights, where you can drink, eat and dance at The Wonderland Ballroom, or find locally brewed beer and delicious food served on outdoor terraces from brunch 'til late at Meridian Pint, Maple, the Kangaroo Boxing Club, Red Rocks Pizza, Room 11, El Chucho taquería, or The Coupe, a 24-hour café, diner and restaurant. Want to go farther? Hop on a Capital Bike to sample adult beverages on 14th Street at the Red Derby rooftop, The Pinch or Ziba´s or to try the Mexican, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants along the way.

,"Hello travelers!We have a cute, smaller-sized bedroom upstairs in our Georgetown townhouse, that is available until August 6th! We would consider renting to someone for a short stay, but would prefer a stay of about week or more. This is a great option if you're in the process of looking for another apartment, or are just in DC temporarily.The bedroom has hardwood floors, and features a window facing T St., a double bed, a new air-conditioning unit, a clothes rack with hangers, a standing lamp, a mirror, and a set of shelves. We can also provide sheets and towels if needed.The house is in an extremely convenient location, just three blocks north of Georgetown University and Hospital; four blocks west of Wisconsin Ave. (including the Social Safeway, open 24 hours); and a few blocks south of the Glover Park neighborhood, with many restaurants, bars, CVS, and Whole Foods. The D2 bus runs three blocks from the house, and gets you to Dupont Circle within about 10 minutes. The Circulator and Metro buses are four blocks away, and get you to M St. in Georgetown in under 10 minutes, and continue to the GW Metro and downtown. Street parking is almost always available, and I can provide you with a temporary parking pass for Zone 2 (no parking tickets!) if needed.There are three bedrooms upstairs in the townhouse, and a bathroom with a skylight, which you would share with two other girls (young professionals). The main floor has a living room, dining room, kitchen, sunroom, and new outdoor deck overlooking our back yard. The basement level has a laundry room, two more bedrooms, and a bathroom. You would have use of all of the common areas (although they are quite crowded with furniture at the moment, as we are in the process of redecorating!). Utilities, including wireless internet, are included as well.The roommates at the house are a fairly international mix of grad students and young professionals, and are not around too much! They are pretty quiet and friendly, and you may get to chat with them in the kitchen when they're cooking in the evenings.I've posted a few photos of the room and bathroom, and am available to talk with you more and answer any questions you might have. Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in staying with us in Georgetown.Thanks, and I look forward to talking with you!",32.0,32,1,-77.075218,32.0,1016,Real Bed,1,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/594394,38.915062,Private room
,"This is a 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom New York-style loft apartment in Washington's vibrant and diverse Mt. Pleasant neighborhood. The apartment has 17-foot (5 meter) ceilings with ceiling fans in both the living room and the bedroom. The apartment is equipped with central heating and air conditioning, so by all means keep it as warm or cool as you prefer. There is no smoking or pets allowed. Make sure to scroll to the end of the photos to see the recent changes. The whole place has been repainted—light gray in the living room, dark gray in the bedroom—and a few things have been rearranged. They're crappy iPhone photos, but I think you get the picture. I've recently bought some new lights to brighten things up a bit, and a new TV for the living room meaning that this apartment has one of the best TV-to-square-footage ratios in DC. LOCATION & TRANSPORTATIONThe apartment is located 2 blocks from the Columbia Heights Metro Station on the Green & Yellow Lines. It is also convenient to the Circulator, 40's, 50's and S bus lines. There are 4 grocery stores within a short walk, and restaurants, coffee shops, and spirits are even closer. The apartment is also a short walk to the lively Adams Morgan Neighborhood and steps from Rock Creek Park and the National Zoo.There is no parking included. The only parking available is metered or time-limited. If you are planning on staying for a longer term, a free guest parking pass can be arranged upon your arrival.SLEEPY TIMEThe bedroom has a desk, a queen bed, 32-inch LCD HDTV w/Cable, and a dresser/armoire for your use. The queen sheets are 800 thread count cotton sateen. There is a medium-fill goose down duvet with a Belgian linen duvet cover. The incredibly comfortable yet supportive mattress also has a mattress pad for additional comfort.There is a second bed for additional guests in the form of a comfortable full/double-sized sleeper sofa. To heighten comfort there is also a mattress pad for the sofa bed. The unit has 17-foot (5 meter) ceilings, with unique details including a full white-painted exposed brick wall in the living room. The decor is ""beach chic"" featuring an eclectic mix of antiques, Ikea, Crate & Barrell, Room & Board, and Restoration Hardware pieces. Outside of the unit there is a small patio area with Weber charcoal grill for your use.All pillows are fluffy Pacific Coast goose down pillows that are regularly cleaned. BATH TIMEThe bathroom is small but highly functional. There is one sink, one toilet, and one shower tub. White amenities and tiles contrast with the native bluestone floor tiles. The bath linens are plush Turkish cotton bath towels. There are additional towels located in the bedroom armoire, along with more linens and wash cloths.FEEDING TIMEThe kitchen is tiny by almost anyone's standards, but it's highly functional. There is a 2-burner electric induction stovetop, black quartz countertops, a chalkboard, sink with garbage disposal, dishwasher, combination microwave/convection/oven and a refrigerator/freezer. There are plates and silverware and serving ware to fit any meal. LOUNGE TIMEThe living room also plays double duty as the dining room—there is a small fold-out table that is hidden inside the living room closet which can comfortably seat 4 people. In addition to the sleeper sofa, there are three other upholstered chairs in the living room. The gray storage ottomans hide additional guest linens and also double as tables when the top is flipped. There is a 52-inch 1080p LCD HDTV with a generous Comcast cable package that includes expanded channels, HBO, Showtime, and Cinemax. There is also a BluRay player (which has Netflix) and a Nintendo Wii with four controllers. There aren't many new games other than Wii Sports and Mario, but it's loaded up with a bunch of old-school original NES titles. What else could you want?There is an antique ladder that is used to hold plush blankets for cuddling up on the couch. OUTDOOR TIMEYou'll notice out front when you walk up that there is a nice little brick patio with banquette seating. There is also a Weber charcoal grill which you can use. Just be mindful of the friendly neighbors in the building, as it is a shared space. The grilling tools are kept inside the main apartment door, to the right when you walk in.MORE ABOUT THE BUILDINGThe building is a walk-up and is not handicapped-accesible. There is a flight of stairs to get from the ground to the front door, and then there is another two flights to reach the apartment. Stairs are annoying, but it's worth it.The building was gutted to the facade and rebuilt from scratch in 2006 so everything inside the building is pretty new. There is a small coin-operated washer and dryer on the first floor upon entering the building. It accepts only quarters (25c) and costs $2.00 per wash and $2.00 per dry. Additionally there are several laundromats and dry cleaners within one block of apartment building.ONE MORE THING...This apartment has been a life-changing home for me and I hope that in whatever time you get to spend here, it feels the same. I'm an insanely neat and tidy person so you'll be getting a place in great condition and would ask that you return it the same. Because this is still my primary residence, you'll see some personal effects around.

,"Located in the historic Capitol Hill neighborhood, this House features three bedrooms and two full bathrooms (just upgraded the half bath to a full bath) and can comfortably accommodate a family of eight. * (if you have more than 8 people in your group you can also rent the lower unit for the total accommodations of 12 (website hidden) ). The property—situated within walking distance of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall—is near the center of the Federal City and offers amenities for a comfortable and memorable stay in one of Washington's oldest and most sought-after neighborhoods. Potomac Metro Station is located around the corner from the property.After Georgetown to the west, Capitol Hill is Washington's oldest neighborhood. In its earliest days, most of the residents were members of Congress who lived in boarding houses and dormitories surrounding the Capitol. As the neighborhood evolved, row-houses replaced boarding houses and the Hill began to grow as a neighborhood filled with families, as well as Washington's who's who. As you walk around this stately neighborhood, don't be surprised if you see faces you've seen in the news. A number of senators and representatives make their home on the Hill.In addition to the U.S. Capitol, the Hill includes other significant American landmarks such as the U.S. Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, the Folger Shakespeare Library, Union Station, the U.S. Marine Corps Barracks, the Washington Naval Yard, Congressional Cemetery, Lincoln Park, and the Eastern Market. All of these sights are within easy walking distance and most are Metro-accessible. Just down the hill from the Capitol is the National Mall with all of the monuments and memorials iconic to Washington, as well as more than 10 museums and galleries of art and artifacts.To the east of the Capitol is the Eastern Market—one of the only remaining merchant markets left in Washington. While the market bustles during the week, it is on the weekends that it acquires its character and charm as residents from all over the city and visitors from all over the world come to the market to enjoy breakfast; purchase fresh meats, produce, and breads; stroll through the adjacent flea market; and browse the latest art and jewelry crafted by local artists and artisans.During the spring and summer months, a visit to the U.S. Marine Corps Barracks at 8th and I Streets SE will allow you to see the Marine Corps Silent Drill Team in action. This 24-man rifle platoon performs precision maneuvers with their 10.5 lb M-1 Garand rifles with fixed bayonets.Over at the U.S. Capitol, the newly opened visitor's center allows visitors to experience the Capitol from the ground up. The center features several state statues in Emancipation Hall and a museum that chronicles the history of the U.S. Capitol from its cornerstone laying in 1789 by George Washington to the present day. Tickets for the Senate and House galleries are available here.The Library of Congress' Jefferson Building, just across the street from the Capitol, is the world's largest repository of books and media in the world. The building is open to the public and the Renaissance and classical art are breathtaking.These and other sites make staying on Capitol Hill a must if you're visiting Washington on business or for pleasure.

,"MONTHLY SUBLET ONLY--NOT AVAILABLE FOR SHORT TERM RENTALThis is a FULLY FURNISHED studio apartment available for sublet starting July 15th, 2013 (although if you need to move in earlier, it can be arranged). It's available for a two month minimum, six month maximum, stay. The cost is $1700 per month plus a refundable upfront $1,700 deposit. UTILITIES ARE INCLUDED!Airbnb censorship removes all email addresses and phone numbers from correspondence sent through their site. Obviously, they want you to book through them so they can receive their massive middleman fee (it’s gone up over the last 18 months); however, if you want to shave at least $100/month off the final rental price, which is added on top of the $1,700/month, then you must search the following in order to find this same posting on a certain website’s DC edition: “$1700 / 450ft² - FURNISHED Sublet available 7-15-2013 / Utilities included (Mount Pleasant)” IMPORTANT: If you decide to go that route then you need an Airbnb/(website hidden)/(website hidden) profile that I can review in order to rent from me. This is how I filter out the scammers. No exceptions.I'll only be responding to inquiries for stays of at least two months but preference will be given to people looking to rent for longer. Please include the purpose of your stay, the dates you will be staying, and any other pertinent information. It usually takes me 6-12 hours to respond. If you don't hear from me in 24 hours, assume the apartment is no longer available for the dates you need it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------APARTMENT DETAILS[Please take the time to read everything if you’re interested as I will not respond to questions that are answered below.]Looking for a quiet apartment of your very own in the heart of DC? Got that summer internship of your dreams? Are you searching for something long-term but stuck crashing on a friend’s couch or in New York Ave hotel? Then you've come to the right posting. This quiet and VERY central studio apartment is available to rent FULLY FURNISHED by the month. GENERAL INFORMATION/NEIGHBORHOOD DESCRIPTION:The studio is on the first floor of a small apartment building located in Mt. Pleasant, a hip neighborhood characterized by independent coffee shops, its own bakery (one of the last left in the District), and several restaurants that locals regard as hidden gems (Marx Cafe, Tonic, and Dos Gringos are just three examples). No car is needed as the green/yellow lines take you into the heart of DC, the Greenbelt metro station (for buses coming from BWI airport), Ronald Reagan National Airport, or L'Enfant Plaza ( for buses coming from Dulles airport). Mt. Pleasant is a five-minute walk to the Columbia Heights Metro (green and yellow lines), a 20 minute walk to Dupont Circle, and a 20 minute metro ride to all the museums and monuments (Archives/Navy Memorial Metro). There's also convenient shopping with Target, two supermarkets, and plenty of coffee chops, liquor stores, and anything you might need during your stay all within a five minute walk.THE APARTMENT:The space can accommodate one person. There is a TV for movie watching, wireless internet, and PC speakers provided for listening to music. Disclaimer: THERE IS NO CABLE TELEVISION, but with so much to do in DC, why would you want to watch tv? Our you can polish your trivia skills thanks to the indie video store literally 50 feet from my front door (one of the last in the district). Towels, sheets, and basic amenities are included such as coffee tea, sugar, etc. The 'Best World' supermarket across the street has anything else you might forget to pack. I cannot emphasize enough how conveniently located this apartment is. My DC friends hate me for it. Full disclosure: the view out of the windows is not inspiring, it looks out into alley. The upside is that there is almost no street noise (the alley is locked and inaccessible to non-tenants). Also, there are coin-operated washers/dryers in the building.WHO YOU ARE:This apartment is ideal for those staying in DC for the summer to do research, complete an internship, or apartment hunt for the perfect place before a permanent move. This is not a place for party animals (see disclaimers), potheads, or anyone else who might attract the attention of the building superintendant.WHAT'S REQUIRED OF YOU:If you are interested in renting the apartment, please describe the nature of your visit and tell me a little about yourself if your profile isn't completed yet or if you are new to Airbnb (if you don't have any reviews). This is not necessary if you are contacting me via C-list and provide a (website hidden) or (website hidden) profile. Also, please make sure your relevant profile has a picture of you and at least two forms verification such as a linked (website hidden) profile or phone number. Again, this helps me avoid scams and insincere requests for information. Lastly, Airbnb requires that hosts declare that all guests are responsible for losses and damages to the apartment up to and BEYOND the security deposit in cases of vandalism or theft.CONTACTING ME:Via Airbnb, if you are booking through their website or via my email address, which is provided in the online classified page I link to in the second paragraph.THINGS TO CONSIDER:There are some DISCLAIMERS because these might be deal-breakers for some people and are not reflected in the photographs because they were taken a year ago:- There is NO cable television, although there is a TV and DVD player. There is also free wireless internet included in the rent.- The bed does not have a metal frame. It is on the bedsprings, which are on the floor. All this means is that the bed sits a little lower than average;-I might have already said this but it's important: subletting is a grey area when it comes to most landlords. They don't approve of it but are not diligent in rooting out the practice. If you, the Airbnb guest, give them cause to do so (parties, noise complaints from neighbors, smoking wacky-tabbaci, etc) you are violating the terms of our agreement and will be made to leave without a refund of your deposit**. This is not a flexible rule and it's a one-strike policy.WHAT NOT TO DO WHILE STAYING AS A GUEST:-NO pets; none; not even turtles; not even for a day.-NO parties (defined as gatherings with loud music and lots of people coming and going)-NO noise pollution after 10 pm and before 9 am - I have neighbors and the property manager lives two doors down. Any instance of disturbing the peace—such as my neighbors complaining—will result in a first warning (unless the landlord gets involved, which gets you ejected) and then the cancellation of the remainder of your reservation without a refund or return of the deposit.-NO smoking (it's a beautiful city, have that cigarette as you walk around outside!)Thank you,George T**For long-term sublets, Airbnb collects the money by the month so if you are asked to leave because of your actions, you would only lose the amount paid for that month and your deposit.",1185.0,1185,1,-77.03754724641948,1185.0,868,Real Bed,1,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/83789,38.93046082195018,Entire home/flat

,"At 3800 square feet. the home has plenty of space for a big family or group or to host a reception or dinner. Designed by Spanish architect Rocio Gonzalez, the home features polished concrete and ipe wood flooring, solar-assisted hot water, abundant natural light, and open, loft-style spaces.We don't like to brag, but we recently hosted a stop on our neighborhood house & garden tour, and people seem to think our house is pretty much a big deal. Our favorite compliment was ""you have so many beautiful modern things, but it's clear that you don't take that too seriously so if you love something, you'll find a way to make it fit in your home."" The animal kingdom: Please note that a talking parrot and a friendly, low-maintenance dog will be staying with you. You can either agree to take on their light care (fresh food, water, outside letting) or we'll need to add $50/day to the price (since we'll need to hire a pet sitter to come while you're here.) The dog is docile and lazy, loving mostly to beg for snacks and get pets. She will bark as anyone approaches the house, which is good for security, but a total pushover after you enter. She's used to having her ears pulled on by kids. The parrot enjoys imitating household noises like sneezes, microwaves, and sinks. He also tends to laugh along when you tell a joke.The little people: We have two daughters, ages 1 and 3, so there's lots of kid stuff in the house, but it's also a rad house for adults without them. If you have kids, feel free to use any of the following: crib, two diaper changing stations, toddler bed, high chair, booster chair, two potties, kids dishes and utensils, plus gobs of toys and games. If you don't have kids, let us know and we can tuck a lot of that out of the way or into the kids' rooms, depending on the size of your party. (On the other hand, you never know which of your dinner party guests will want to ride a tricycle around the room after a few glasses of wine.) The house has easy to clean surfaces all-around.Spaces in our home: **Living Room: this large, sun-drenched room opens into the dining room and kitchen, and features a sectional couch that seats 9+ comfortably and a working wood-burning fireplace. **Dining Room: includes a table that can fit 12 to eat. **Kitchen: fully equipped with stainless steel counters, an extra wide convection oven, induction cooktop stove, dishwasher, microwave, Kitchenaid stand mixer, plus many kitchen tools, pots, pans, small appliances like a juicer, blender, and food processor, and enough Fiestaware and glassware to serve 16+ people. **Den: a cozy space with a couch, two armchairs, large flat screen TV with DirectTV cable, Wii, and DVD player. This is where the parrot's cage is. **Office/Crafts Room: honestly this is sort of our junk room, but it's pretty tidy, so you could easily find sunny space here to pen a letter, mend a shirt, park a laptop, or undertake other small projects. **Playloft: with a canvas teepee, a magnetic chalkboard wall, an easel, and a rug that's perfect for building wooden train track sets on. **2 Kids' Rooms: one with a crib and changing table and the other with a toddler bed. Both are big enough to place an air mattress in, if you want to double up with older kids or use these as sleeping rooms for adults who don't mind waking up next to a shelf full of Eric Carle books. **Master bedroom: a peaceful room that includes a queen-sized memory foam mattress platform bed, a flat-screen TV with cable and a DVD player. **Guest Bedroom: double-sized mattress bed. **Reading Loft: double-sized futon that easily folds down to sleep two more people if you need. **Bathrooms: 4.5 bathrooms, as follows: a 1/2 bath off the office and a full bath with a shower off the den. Full bath with large tub across from the kids' rooms, full bath with a small shower off the guest room, and full bath with separate shower and two-person jacuzzi tub across from the master bedroom. **Other spaces: small library with two armchairs across from living room, a ""rumpus room"" outfitted with gymnastics stuff and toys (but also useful for adults who do yoga, etc.), and a washer and dryer in a small laundry closet near the bedrooms.So, in case you lost count, there are two beds (4 people total), plus a futon (2), and we also have a double and twin air mattress and pack-n-play portable crib for your use, plus the crib and kids bed, and couches that could accommodate another 3 adults. You could fit a lot of folks. Or just luxuriate with 1 or 2 people who like a lot of space.The great outdoors: First, the house is up 26 steps from the street. That's the only way in and out. You might not want to pack the biggest suitcase ever. (We tend to leave our stroller in the car to avoid hauling it up and down.) Front patio: this space is south-facing and full of sun, teak wood table and chairs for 6, patio umbrella, charcoal grill, lots of potted plants, a productive herb garden, and a vegetable patch. Because the house is raised from the street, the front patio has a great view over the cute neighborhood. Backyard: large shaded, grassy area, table and several lawn chairs, large hammock, baby swing, and a charcoal grill. There's also a tool shed in the backyard if you need a full wrench set or to peek at our Christmas decorations in July.We will not be present during your stay. We live on a beautiful, quiet block with lots of friendly neighbors. We're one block off Brookland's little commercial core (12th Street), which has a hardware store, post office, drug store/pharmacy, upscale Cuban restaurant, nail salon, and several other little shops and casual or take-out food places. You can also easily walk to parks, a monastery with a beautiful public garden, and the Catholic University campus.CAR: You should have no problem finding easy parking on our block, probably right in front of the house. TRANSIT: It's a 10-minute walk to the Brookland Metro Station, which is on the metro red line, just three stops from Union Station and a couple more into the heart of DC. There are also several bus lines within a couple of blocks that run into other neighborhoods like Columbia Heights. BIKE: There are two Capital Bikeshare stations within two blocks, where you can rent bikes short-term using a credit card.TAXI: You can call a taxi to the house, or easily hail one from downtown or major sights. We're basically a $20 one way cab ride from downtown or most sights.",12.125,97,4,-76.99079078667708,24.25,1294,Real Bed,8,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1248752,38.9297572966148,Entire home/flat

From (phone number hidden), private developers invested over $1 billion to begin the development of office, residential, hotel, and retail space in a 35-block area over the next 10 years. Development has ushered in a number of prominent commercial businesses, government organizations, and retail establishments; including NPR, CNN, Sirius XM, Harris Teeter, Roti, Potbelly Sandwich Shop, and others.

,"Experience the Parkview/Petworth area: a beautiful and relaxed mix of old and new DC with things to do and convenience to other DC highlights. My apartment is a studio with a bedroom nook and a full-size bed. It has a separate kitchen area and closet which opens into the bathroom. The rest of the studio is a living space with a tv. It's in a historic (but well maintained) elevator building just steps from the Georgia Avenue/Petworth metro station (green and yellow line). Literally, its across the street. There are also several bus lines that run around the city and pick up a block from the apartment building. The apartment is pretty simple and has enough space for 2 people - I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. There is cable and wireless internet, full kitchen, A/C and fans to keep cool in the heat. There are several great bars in the area (I recommend looking glass lounge (2 blocks away) and red derby (14th & Quincy)). It's also walking distance or just one stop away from the Columbia Heights area which also has lots of great stores, restaurant, and an awesome farmer's market on the weekend. You're also not too far from Rock Creek Park which is awesome for biking, running or just taking a walk. The metro also makes this apartment really convenient to main tourist attractions downtown including the monuments and the mall.If you're looking for groceries, there is a Yes Organic Market nearby and a Giant grocery store at the columbia heights metro. I also highly recommend Chez Billy's (french bistro) and the Jerk Chicken Wings at Sweet Mango. If you're interested, please send me a message!

Sure you could spend your nights in an expensive hotel or out in the suburbs, but why would you want to?Centrally located, your home in DC is less than a 10 minute walk from Dupont Metro Station taking you close to the Capitol, White House, Chinatown or one metro transfer away from museums and a host of other local attractions. You're also a 10 minute walk from Adams Morgan (bars, restaurants), a 25 minute walk from Georgetown (shopping and more shopping), a 20 minute walk from U Street (restaurants, bars, clubs) or a 20 minute walk from the National Zoo (animals and such). Though it's close to the action the apartment building is located on a very quiet and very safe residential street, near parks (Rock Creek), a church and supermarkets (a small one is literally right next door). If you prefer to bike around, 3 Capital Bikeshare stations (hosting 52 bicycles) can be found between 2 and 4 blocks away. Location-wise it can't be beat.The apartment itself is fully furnished, very spacious, and gets tons of indirect natural light. The bedroom can host 2 people on a queen size bed, and the living room can host an additional 2 on a super comfortable queen size air mattress (memory foam topper included). A full kitchen and bath is ready to use as is free wifi, a 46"" LCD TV, and my Boxee Box (an alternative to cable, sort of like AppleTV/Roku). The air conditioner/heater in the living room works well.One important thing to keep in mind is that I live here most of time so closet and storage space is limited, though I will make arrangements to ensure you're completely comfortable. Clean sheets and towels are naturally provided.Made it all the way to the bottom? Wow.

I love meeting people who come through DC & am happy to let you do your thing, or hang out/give you recommendations if you're wanting to socialize. I'm often busy at work so I won't be in your way. I keep extra SmarTrip cards in the house for guests, which saves you a few cents on the metro as well. I'm laid-back and friendly and love to host! I don't smoke and ask that you do so only outside. I don't usually have pets, but well-behaved critters are welcome! My Roommate, Kayla:The room pictured is Kayla's room. One or the other of us is out of town if you're staying here. Kayla is a friendly, laid-back, non-profit professional and dedicated pup parent who moved to DC from Boston in April 2013. She has lived abroad and likes travelling too. The pup, Sahara:Sahara was rescued in Puerto Rico and was lucky enough to be brought to a partner shelter in the US, where she was adopted by Kayla! She is a sweet-tempered, cuddly corgi/dachsund/beagle/?? mix, and will gladly snuggle on the couch with you. She's also good at respecting your space if you prefer not to hang out with her. She's about 3 yo and very well-behaved. As of April 2013, she was new to apartments and was learning *not* to alert us when people come in the apt building door :). She goes to sleep early and doesn't get up till we do, so she is unlikely to wake you if she does bark, but there's our disclaimer!Hope you enjoy your stay, with me or anywhere in the city.

,"My gorgeous large studio is located in Dupont Circle neighborhood, arguably the best neighborhood in DC, with a great mix of housing and retail, good connections to the city’s transportation network, and proximity to downtown. The area is very walkable, and it shows: 38% of Logan Circle residents walk all the way to their jobs... I am sure the other part rides their bikes. There is a park close by and everything is at hand, from a hardware store to CVS, gardening, bike store, bookstores, grocery stores, yoga, restaurants, banks, and much more!THE STUDIO: The apartment is very well distributed with lots of light and beautiful 10-foot ceilings, about 400 square foot in size. It is on the third floor, is very comfortable (has a full-size bed and a full-size sofa bed for guests). Also it has a spacious closet, antique hardwood floors, and a beautiful bathroom (with a large bathtub), Comcast high-speed Internet and a small TV. You also have lovely views from the apartment onto historic Victorian townhomes in the area. It is very nicely fully furnished as I have put some time and effort to decorate it and make it home. I would like to host people that are caring and appreciate my place. The people at the building are really nice and it is calm. There is great space in the basement for keeping your bicycle safe (as in DC bikes tend to have a short term life span...) I enjoy much doing my laundry at Swift cleaners in 17 and R or at MacDee cleaners at 1408 P Street.NEIGHBORHOOD: The neighborhood is very safe, convenient, trendy, yet quiet. There are many art galleries, high-end furniture and home goods stores, great restaurants and bars, organic food stores, yoga, and lounges with nice terraces for having a drink after work, etc. Also, the 14th Street corridor is just one block away with some of the best restaurants, music halls, clubs, and other cool hangout places of the city. Also, on P Street, there is a Whole Foods market, a hardware store, a Wells Fargo bank, any many other stores and restaurants.TRANSPORTATION: For metro access, the place is 5 blocks to McPherson Square (blue/orange), 6 blocks to Dupont Circle or 7 to Farragut North (red), and 6 blocks to Shaw/Howard or 7 to U Street (green). You also have the circulator (bus) that takes you straight downtown, but also connecting Logan Circle and Adams Morgan by way of U Street. In addition, the 52/53/54 buses run pretty frequently along 14th Street, connecting the neighborhood to Columbia Heights, Downtown, and L’Enfant Plaza. Also, a large number of ZipCar stations are close by and a Capital bikeshare station is at 14th Street and Rhode Island Avenue.Thanks and enjoy!",35.5,71,1,-77.03551086888871,71.0,502,Real Bed,2,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/889384,38.91274837320667,Entire home/flat

In minutes you are at Union Station where you can walk or hop on the metro -METRO: Access to the either the red line or the green/yellow line are each an 8 minute bike ride or 20 minute walk through beautiful neighborhoods. -BIKE: Another great way to get to the metro or around town is to rent a bike from one of the docking stations just steps outside our back door ((website hidden)). You can park the bike at any of 110 locations around the city. We really encourage this!-CAR: Although we do not recommend driving around DC (there are great transportation options), parking is easy on our block because DC utilizes a permit system. When you provide us with your state and tag number we provide a temporary permit good for your stay, which allows you free parking on our street and anywhere on Capitol Hill.THINGS TO NOTE-If you are allergic to dogs and/or cats, this is not a place for you, as we have one of each. We would like to leave the cat at home while we are away; the dog will be away-We renovated the entire house before we moved in last year. Everything is new inside. -You can use the back entrance which opens onto an alley and a field. You can see the bikeshare from the back of the house. -Our cat, Little Rock, is indoor and outdoor, and very low maintenance. We'd love to leave her at home during your stay. We can make arrangements for our dog to be outside of the home, although we would be happy to offer a discount for someone who could take proper care of her. There is a dog park steps away from our backdoor, making it something that might be appealing to a dog-loving family. -We have been hosting Airbnb guests in our basement suite since last year and have loved it. It's been great to help people enjoy their time in DC. We're putting the whole house (minus the basement suite) on Airbnb for the times that we will be away this summer. We are reserving the basement suite in case we need to use it (just Ken and the dog, not Nicole or the kids). -The house has a queen bed in the master bedroom and a twin bed in each of the kids bedrooms. 2 more people could be accommodated on the floor of the kids rooms, or on an air mattress in the family room. If you have more people in your party, we can discuss how this might work.",29.666666666666668,178,3,-76.98836589427553,59.333333333333336,898,Real Bed,6,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/437362,38.89558708617039,Entire home/flat

,"You have found The One, but be sure to message me before booking my place to confirm its availability. The ideal guest is a one- to four-month visitor, which is why the pricing is reduced for longer stays. There's a 2-night minimum. Availability is from March 20, 2012, onward, unless the calendar denotes otherwise. Your great 10' x 10' private, furnished room with twin-size bed, cable TV, and attached bathroom in the heart of D.C.'s attractions is private and fresh. This bright setup accommodates one person comfortably, but not more than one person. Feel free to check in anytime; checkout is at or before 2 p.m. on your day of departure, unless we arrange later, with a minimum stay of only two nights. This is ideal for visiting researchers, interns, graduate students, and others in town for a focused project. Your housemate is a frequently traveling lawyer. No wild parties, rare overnight guests, but always cordial relations. Remember to think carefully about where you prefer to stay. [AirBnB sometimes lists my condo as being in Chinatown, but it's actually in Downtown proper, three blocks from Metro Center and four blocks from Gallery Place/Chinatown Stations, with views of the D.C. Convention Center and three blocks from transit points for MegaBus and BoltBus (to Philadelphia, New York, etc.).]When in our nation's capital, do you prefer to be half a mile (six blocks) from the White House? How about a 7-minute $1 bus ride from Union Station/Capitol Hill? And a 10-minute walk from DuPont Circle? Or a four-minute walk from the Washington Convention Center? Do you like the idea of being within four blocks of subway stations at Metro Center, McPherson, and Gallery Place (Verizon Center)? And a 10-minute taxi ride from National Airport? If you answered ""yes,"" then be my guest in Northwest. Enjoy your private room and your own bathroom in my beautiful, spotless corner unit in a high-rise, secured luxury building 7 minutes by Circulator bus from Capitol Hill and 15 minutes from Georgetown. The festive Circulator bus stops 1/2 block from my front door. Check out the map and street views associated with this listing. You're three or four blocks from all five Metrorail lines, too.Your space is the room pictured here, with the Tiffany lamp, the large bookcases and desk, and the twin-size bed with blue pillows and red/blue spread. The bed is a Chester Convertible, which is like a steel cot. I leave it permanently in its out position and fully dressed. 35 years old and with sturdy mattress-like springs, it is heavy and features a thick foam mattress I had custom-made in 2007 to replace the mattress that had been on the bed since my grandmother bought it many decades ago.For longer stays -- those of six or more days -- breakfast is not included. (For short stays, breakfast is cereal, fruit, and fruit juice, usually. I also keep instant oatmeal. I can pick up some donuts for you ahead of time, although I try to stay away from that stuff myself.)When time permits, I can shuttle you to and/or from any of the three D.C.-area airports in my spacious, luxurious automobile, with its space conveniently located in the building, or you can bring your own car and park it in a garage nearby.After you have arrived, nobody gets in your way. Outside your room, feel free to relax in your well-appointed living areas of this high-end condominium, as photographed. 50% down as a security deposit (easily refundable, though, at 100%, per AirBnB) a few days before your arrival. This 2005-built building features expansive views and concierge services including dry cleaning. In our 14 stories are a gym, an internal bike rack, a pool table, and a nice roof deck.Who am I? A straight-shooting, slightly hyper-educated but approachable lawyer who works from 8:45 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. most weekdays and devotes his Saturdays to tennis (May-September), fitness, and social meetings. Sundays, it's off to church (7:45 a.m.), family and friends, and sometimes the office, too. I have a somewhat conservative lifestyle but vote Democratic. I voted for Hillary. I keep a business-oriented weekly calendar in the heart of one of the world's great cities, all from a 985 square-foot condominium I am happy to share from time to time. The listed amount is a bargain, given the appeal of this building, with its granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, Brazilian cherry hardwood floors, plush carpeting, and ceramic tile flooring. My rate is negotiable for stays of five or more days, too. Regardless of your intentions, please always message me before you book the space so that we can confirm your comfort level and the space's availability. While I do expect to clean a lot on your behalf before and after you leave, I must advise now that if you're sloppy -- break dishes, slam doors, don't understand how to keep a microwave clean, and/or leave fingerprints on glass without noticing -- then we won't make good roommates. The goal is that the home remain orderly but social, with mutual respect. You are paying to be here, of course, so I will give you at least some grace. Visiting scholars/researchers, advanced students, and other responsible, non-smoking persons present the best possibilities. No smoking allowed inside the unit, but on the roof deck is fine. No pets.

,"Located in the historic Capitol Hill neighborhood, this unit features one bedroom and one bathroom as well as living room sleeper sofa and can accommodate comfortably up to four. The property—situated within walking distance of the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall—is near the center of the Federal City and offers amenities for a comfortable and memorable stay in one of Washington's oldest and most sought-after neighborhoods. Potomac Metro Station is located around the corner from the property.After Georgetown to the west, Capitol Hill is Washington's oldest neighborhood. In its earliest days, most of the residents were members of Congress who lived in boarding houses and dormitories surrounding the Capitol. As the neighborhood evolved, row houses replaced boarding houses and the Hill began to grow as a neighborhood filled with families, as well as Washington's who's who. As you walk around this stately neighborhood, don't be surprised if you see faces you've seen in the news. A number of senators and representatives make their home on the Hill.In addition to the U.S. Capitol, the Hill includes other significant American landmarks such as the U.S. Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, the Folger Shakespeare Library, Union Station, the U.S. Marine Corps Barracks, the Washington Naval Yard, Congressional Cemetery, Lincoln Park, and the Eastern Market. All of these sights are within easy walking distance and most are Metro-accessible. Just down the hill from the Capitol is the National Mall with all of the monuments and memorials iconic to Washington, as well as more than 10 museums and galleries of art and artifacts.To the east of the Capitol is the Eastern Market—one of the only remaining merchant markets left in Washington. While the market bustles during the week, it is on the weekends that it acquires its character and charm as residents from all over the city and visitors from all over the world come to the market to enjoy breakfast; purchase fresh meats, produce, and breads; stroll through the adjacent flea market; and browse the latest art and jewelry crafted by local artists and artisans.During the spring and summer months, a visit to the U.S. Marine Corps Barracks at 8th and I Streets SE will allow you to see the Marine Corps Silent Drill Team in action. This 24-man rifle platoon performs precision maneuvers with their 10.5 lb M-1 Garand rifles with fixed bayonets.Over at the U.S. Capitol, the newly opened visitor's center allows visitors to experience the Capitol from the ground up. The center features several state statues in Emancipation Hall and a museum that chronicles the history of the U.S. Capitol from its cornerstone laying in 1789 by George Washington to the present day. Tickets for the Senate and House galleries are available here.The Library of Congress' Jefferson Building, just across the street from the Capitol, is the world's largest repository of books and media in the world. The building is open to the public and the Renaissance and classical art are breathtaking.These and other sites make staying on Capitol Hill a must if you're visiting Washington on business or for pleasure.Enjoy your stay.Allen",22.5,90,1,-76.988144,90.0,898,Real Bed,4,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/677900,38.880665,Entire home/flat

,"Welcome visitors! I've lived in Washington DC for nearly a decade, and I really took my time to find the ""right"" place before I bought this apartment. When looking for properties, my concerns were likely much the same that I imagine that you have - convenience, comfort, and safety. I am being totally upfront with you when I say that my apartment definitely has all three!Regarding convenience, let's face it - who wants to spend half their vacation just getting from here to there or wandering around trying to find a good place to eat? My apartment is walkable to every metro line with the closest metro stop only 0.2 miles (roughly 0.3 km) away and it's also near a major highway that will get you in and out of the city without requiring you to stop at tons of traffic lights. My apartment is walkable to the Capital building, the National Mall, Smithsonian museums, the Convention Center, and Verizon Center (home to our professional hockey and basketball teams as well as the site of many concerts and events). The apartment is also directly across the street from a grocery store that is open 24/7, a Starbucks coffee shop with free Wi-Fi, and several delicious restaurants. There is also a Capital Bikeshare kiosk (where you can rent a bike) about a block away. The apartment building itself also has a gym, billiards room, and pool (open seasonally) that you are welcome to use. I am also offering my guests free assigned on-site parking in a garage beneath the building - a huge savings over many of the hotel valet fees!!!As for comfort - you want to ENJOY your stay and not spend half the time with kinks in your back from trying to sleep on someone's partially deflated air mattress! My apartment is extremely comfortable and I'm confident that you will agree. I am a person who really needs their sleep so I splurged on a very nice queen-sized mattress and even all of my friends who have stayed with me have commented on how nice my bed is to sleep in. The bedroom has a queen-sized bed that sleeps two and I also have a large sectional sofa in the main room that easily sleeps one, possibly two if at least one of the two is a child. So the apartment easily sleeps three, but could potentially sleep up to four people. I'm being upfront here though when I tell you that four people is a bit of a squeeze. Regarding safety, this apartment is in a locked building with security cameras and a security guard. The residents are friendly but do not allow strangers to follow them into the building - and I ask you to do the same. We've never had any problems in the building and that is due to everyone's vigilance. We live in a very desirable and safe neighborhood but even good neighborhoods have bad people wander into them from time to time. Washington DC is not a crime-free city so safety should always be a priority for everyone - no matter which option you choose on AirBnB. Please be safe everyone!Now down to the finer details. Here's what my apartment offers:* Table with four chairs* Island countertop bar with three bar stools* Large white leather sectional sofa (sleeps one adult plus one child or one adult only)(two adults will not fit!)* 42 inch (approximately 107 cm) high definition (HD) TV * DVD player* One very large bookcase plus one smaller one* Plates, cups, silverware* Modern, open kitchen* Toaster* Microwave* Oven* Refrigerator with ice maker* Dishwasher* Full bathroom with bathtub / shower, toilet, sink* Washing machine and clothes dryer in the unit (free for you, no need to get change to do your laundry!)* Large master bedroom with luxury queen-sized mattress on the bed (sleeps two adults comfortably)* Large computer desk with chair (computer not included)* Very large walk-in closet* Two full-sized dressers* Two nightstands with drawers* Lots of natural light from large windows (with window treatments so that you can shut out that light if you need to!)* Private balcony with outdoor table and two chairs* On-site gym * On-site billiards room* Rooftop pool (open seasonally)* Free assigned on-site parking in a secure garage* Extreme convenience - whether you prefer to explore the city by foot, metro system, bike, or car!One caveat - I am extremely allergic to smoke so please NO SMOKING IN THE BUILDING. If you are a smoker, you are free to smoke outside the building at any time. Any questions? Feel free to reach out.

Behind the Capitol building is the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress. Union Station, at the northern end of Capitol Hill, is not only Washington DC's main rail terminal, but also one of the most popular tourist attractions due to its recent renovation.Union Station, Washington's main rail terminal, was designed to act as a monumental gateway to the nation's capital city and is located conveniently close to the U.S. Capitol Building, the National Mall and other attractions such as the National Gallery of Art. Since extensive renovation in the 1980s, the Union Station building now houses cafes, restaurants, and stores. Points of interest within Union Station include the carefully restored main waiting room, a 96 foot chamber with gold-leaf ceiling, that is now used for Balls and other festive events and the Presidential waiting room in the East hall. Just outside Union Station are the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building and National Postal Museum.",32.333333333333336,97,1,-77.003021,97.0,898,Real Bed,3,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/657771,38.896362,Entire home/flat

It's only a few dollars and very quick!Since I usually rent out just one bedroom and live in the other, one of the rooms will have my things in it. (Tucked to the side, of course.)

,"When I travel, I sublet my fantastic 1 bedroom / 1 bathroom English Basement apartment in the heart of Columbia Heights. Here are the details. Feel free to contact me with any questions.THE SPACE:The unit is fully furnished in mid-century modern decor, including a chic wood/leather sofa and a huge dining room table. The kitchen boasts new sleek appliances, the bathroom has a beautifully tiled large shower, the living area has a huge 42"" flat screen LCD TV, and the bedroom has a queen sized bed (and an additional television). Washer/Dryer unit in apartment. There are two windows in the living room, two in the bedroom, one in the bathroom, and one on the back door -- so it feels much more like a standard apartment than other English Basements (trust me, I looked at many when I moved to DC from Los Angeles, where I was used to lots of natural light). Great, spacious open floor plan for those with a modern aesthetic. The space is clean and remains quiet despite being just half a block from 14th street in Columbia Heights, one of the hippest and most sought after residential areas in the city.AMENITIES:- Fully Furnished- Central Air Conditioning- Two televisions both with DVD players- Cable w/ DVR included- WiFi internet included- Washer/Dryer unit in apartment- Private front and back entrancePUBLIC TRANSIT/PARKING:Conveniently located between Columbia Heights Metro (6 min walk) and Petworth Metro (8 min walk) stations.

Target, Washington Sports Club Gym, and 24 hour Giant grocery store are just a 5 min walk away. As well as tons of restaurants/bars.WHAT IS AN ENGLISH BASEMENT?- An English basement is an apartment on the lowest floor of a building, generally a townhouse or brownstone, which is partially below and partially above ground level and which has its own separate entrance from the rest of the building. English basements are often rented out separately from the main dwelling, either by a single landlord who owns both portions of the building or by a tenant of the building who sub-lets the English basement. English basements are most common in larger, older cities like London, New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. ((website hidden)_basement)- As this is a basement unit, there are lower ceilings than a standard apartment. Also, this basement unit does not have direct temperature control of the heat/AC, as it is controlled upstairs in the main house. This has never been a problem for me or my guests.- This is not a shared space. You will have no roommates (unless you bring one). The unit has its own kitchen area, bathroom, and private front and rear entrances.",32.5,65,1,-77.03236751469132,65.0,867,Real Bed,2,https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/1097567,38.933124856377766,Entire home/flat

For more on this great neighborhood, check out Airbnb's Neighborhood Guide - https://www.airbnb.com/locations/washington-dc/near-northeastGUIDANCE:I seldom stay in hotels anymore. I use Airbnb almost every time I travel. The biggest reason for this is that when I visit a place, I like to experience it like a local, and the best way to do that is by staying with one. That said, what I love to provide most to visitors and fellow travelers is guidance. If you have any questions or need help getting around or ideas of what to do or where to eat, I'd love to help. I adore D.C. and everything it has to offer. My true passion is showing visitors my favorite spots- from the best museums and sites to the cheapest (and yummiest) eats. I'm one of the few, yet proud, native Washingtonians in D.C. and am looking forward to sharing recommendations with you borne out of a few decades of living here.

(My ""extra person"" fee kicks in cos you'll need add'l bed linens.)TRANSPORTATIONAccess to transportation honestly couldn’t be easier. (Though if you’re in DC on business, you can reach downtown in a few minutes walking.) You can catch a cab out front or walk to one of 3 metro stops within 10-15 minutes. (These 3 stops provide access to all lines: Metro Center has red, orange, and blue; Mt. Vernon Sq/7th St/Convention Ctr has yellow and green, or McPherson Sq. has orange and blue. Bonus is Dupont Circle for the red line about a 15 minute walk in case that’s the direction you’re headed.) Major bus lines in each direction are at most 2 streets away. There are also plenty of Zipcars right in the neighborhood and several Capital Bikeshare stations very near. A cab or bus from Union Station (train) takes about 15 minutes and all 3 airports IDulles Int’l, Reagan National, and BWI) are accessible by public transportation. (Dulles is a little more arduous by public transport but it's WAY cheaper than a taxi and often quicker. I'm happy to share the details.)OTHERSince this is my home, my stuff is (of course) in the closets and cupboards. However, I’ll clear closet space for you and have a large cupboard shelf and a few drawers available for your use. I’m looking for a cat lover to take care of Jupiter for me (daily affection, feeding, water change, litter box scooping, occasional brushing, which he loves).Please let me know of your interest, including your dates, and any questions.

,"My apartment is a modest, 7th floor studio overlooking the ""good side"" of Embassy Row, just a minute from Dupont Circle. Futon-bed and a couch. High-speed internet, AC, a bluetooth-able stereo. Wide selection of nearby street parking (free on the weekends, but there's also a few garages nearby for a decent price). Feel free to use the kitchen, so long as you clean up.You can pretty much walk anywhere from this location: the north side of Dupont is a five minute walk from GWU, U Street, and Adams Morgan. The metro's only two blocks away (Red Line), and the park itself is a great spot to people-watch. The fancier side of the circle moves toward Logan, which has a great restaurant scene, though most of my favorite spots are on Connecticut--just a three minute jaunt down Florida Avenue--and there's a small farmers' market on Sunday morning. There's also a $10 burger-and-beer deal right next door at Bier Baron (every night until 8!), and no shortage of great places to brunch. The best Middle Eastern food you will ever eat in your life (and believe me: I'd know) is just up the street, too, and they're open late.The building itself has a reception desk and there's a key fob (I'll provide it for you) to get in. There's also a roof (accessible from the staircase right across from my door, two floors up) with tables and lounge chairs, and laundry facilities downstairs (I'll have a card ready for you if you'd like to utilize it). If you're a runner, I can recommend some good trails that take you into Georgetown and along the river--along with some routes (with almost no lights!) that will bring you up to the Lincoln Memorial.
